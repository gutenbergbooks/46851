<h2>
AUTHOR&rsquo;S PREFACE.
</h2>


<p>
The increasing recognition of the importance of the
preservation of antiquities justifies the publication
of a handbook dealing with this subject. As far as I
can ascertain, with the exception of a short article<a name='FA_1'
id='FA_1' href='#FN_1' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> for
which I am myself responsible, only one work has appeared
which covers the whole field&mdash;the &ldquo;Merkbuch<a name='FA_2'
id='FA_2' href='#FN_2' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>&rdquo;
prepared by Dr Voss at the request of the Government.
But as this book only gives a selection of the known
methods of preservation, the need of a more comprehensive
publication will scarcely be denied.
</p>

<p>
In spite of my ten years&rsquo; experience in the special
Laboratory of the Royal Museums and the frequent
opportunities of learning the methods in use elsewhere,
which the journeys and correspondence arising out of my
duties have given me during this period, I do not feel
competent to produce a review of these various methods
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_vi' name='Page_vi' href='#Page_vi'>
[vi]</a></span>
which will be at once exhaustive and sufficiently critical.
There are several reasons for this. In the first place the
individual methods have been but rarely published, and
even then through the most varied literary media; often
they are only casually mentioned in articles dealing with
anthropological or historical subjects. On the other hand,
the value of an object to be dealt with may prohibit an
attempt at treatment, the success of which is not assured.
My own experience has been gained by trials with
objects chiefly from the Egyptian section, but also to
some extent from the Antiquarian and Numismatic
departments of the Royal Museums.
</p>

<p>
This deficiency can only be remedied by a work such
as that now offered to the public, and it is to be hoped
that this handbook will stimulate the Curators of State,
Municipal and Societies&rsquo; Collections, as well as private
collectors and others interested in the subject, to make
public their further experiences in this field of archaeology.
I take this opportunity, therefore, of expressing
the hope that I may receive other communications
bearing upon the subject and may thus perhaps at some
future date be able to produce a more complete work.
</p>

<p>
In using the book it will be noticed that for the
proper understanding of the first portion, which deals
with the causes of destruction, a certain amount of
chemical knowledge is assumed. In the second portion,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_vii' name='Page_vii' href='#Page_vii'>
[vii]</a></span>
however, the methods of preservation are treated from a
more elementary standpoint, and the simple apparatus
and manipulations required are so described that the
treatment may be readily carried out by those who are
unfamiliar with chemical methods.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, I take this opportunity of expressing
my thanks to all those who have given their help, and
especially to Dr Otto Olshausen for his continued interest
in the work of the Museum Laboratory and in the
production of this handbook. Especially am I indebted
to his extensive knowledge of anthropological literature
for many references which would otherwise have escaped
my notice.

<h2>
TRANSLATORS&rsquo; PREFACE.
</h2>


<p>
Dr Rathgen has, in his preface, stated the aim of
this handbook, and it is with a desire to further
this aim that we have prepared an English translation.
</p>

<p>
Claiming but limited experience in this field of research
we have only added such explanatory notes as seem
in some way to bear upon the subject or likely to be
useful in a handbook of this kind (viz. the method of
taking squeezes, Appendix A, and a few footnotes which
are signed and enclosed in square brackets). We take this
opportunity of thanking Dr Rathgen for his interest in
our undertaking, for his kindness in supplying much
additional matter which did not appear in the German
edition, and also for the loan of the blocks for Figs.
<a href="#Fig_22">22</a>
and <a href="#Fig_23">23</a>. Figs. <a href="#Fig_7">7</a>,
<a href="#Fig_9">9</a>-<a href="#Fig_12">12</a>,
<a href="#Fig_30">30</a>-<a href="#Fig_33">33</a>, and
<a href="#Fig_37">37</a>, are from photographs
of objects treated by ourselves.
</p>

<p>
Our thanks are especially due to Dr W. A. Caspari, of
the National Physical Laboratory, for his invaluable help
in the revision of the translation, and for his advice and
suggestions in reference to the more technical aspect of
the work.

PART I.<br />
<span class="small">THE CHANGES UNDERGONE BY ANTIQUITIES IN
EARTH AND IN AIR.</span>
</h2>



<p>
The greater number of those objects of antiquity which
are composed of inorganic materials, such as limestone, earthenware,
and metals, owe the commencement of any alteration in
their character to the situation in which they are discovered,
since they are buried in ground which has been at some period
damp or wet, and has contained, moreover, salts soluble in
water. Amongst these salts the most usual is sodium chloride
(common salt), but this is mostly accompanied by potassium
chloride, potassium sulphate, magnesium chloride, and calcium
sulphate; in short, by those soluble salts which are found in
sea-water. In the fine pores of Egyptian antiquities, especially,
such salts occur, and their presence is readily explained by
the fact that the land of Egypt was originally a sea-bottom.
</p>

<p>
The presence of salt in the soil of Egypt has been known
for a considerable period. Thus Karabacek<a name='FA_3' id='FA_3'
href='#FN_3' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a>, quoting from
Volney&rsquo;s &ldquo;Travels in Syria and Egypt&rdquo; (Jena, 1788,
<span class='smcap'>I.</span> p. 13):
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
&ldquo;Wherever one digs one finds brackish water containing
soda, sea-salt, and a small quantity of saltpetre.
Indeed, when a garden has been flooded for irrigation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' name='Page_2' href='#Page_2'>
[2]</a></span>
purposes, crystals of salt make their appearance on the
surface after the water has evaporated or has been
soaked up by the soil.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
In the dry climate of Egypt, objects saturated with salt
keep better after their removal from the ground than in our
climate, where the variations in the temperature and in the
hygroscopic condition of the air produce a partial deliquescence
in wet weather, and in dry weather a re-formation of crystals.
The continued alternation of these processes gradually loosens
the surface of limestone or earthenware, or induces certain
chemical changes in objects of metal and in both cases leads
to their destruction.
</p>


<h3>
<span class='smcap'>Limestone and Clay.</span>
</h3>

<p>
The series of changes are particularly well illustrated by
the Egyptian grave of Meten<a name='FA_4' id='FA_4' href='#FN_4'
class='fnanchor'>[4]</a>, the stones from which are
now in the Royal Museum in Berlin. The three illustrations
here given show: (1) an undecayed block of limestone, (2) a
block with pitted surface, and (3) a block the surface of which
was formerly covered with hieroglyphics, but which is now
totally destroyed by flaking. The blocks of the latter kind
were found in the lowest layer, or lowest but one, while
those blocks which were above were the best preserved. As
the amount of salt present scarcely varied, these specimens
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>
<a id='Page_4' name='Page_4' href='#Page_4'>[4]</a></span>
offer a striking illustration of the greater influence of moisture
in the deeper soil than at the higher levels.

</p>
</div>

<p>
Baked clay, particularly that of Egyptian ostraca (i.e.
fragments of pottery showing inscriptions), exhibits similar
changes, as is shown in the accompanying illustrations. The
surface of some fragments is found to be almost completely
covered with a layer of salt, which, apart from impurities
of clay and dust and remains of the black lettering, consists
of almost pure sodium chloride; only a trace of magnesium
sulphate being found on analysis.
</p>

<p>
In contrast with this very loose superficial incrustation,
the inner portions of the ostracon contained considerable
quantities of sulphates. Figure <a href="#Fig_4">4</a> represents a
fragment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5' href='#Page_5'>
[5]</a></span>
with granular efflorescences of sodium chloride, and also fine
needles of magnesium sulphate<a name='FA_5' id='FA_5' href='#FN_5'
class='fnanchor'>[5]</a>. As a general rule the
amount of salt is small compared with the bulk of clay or
limestone: thus it was found by titration that three separate
fragments contained 0&middot;13, 0&middot;20, and 0&middot;48%
calculated as
sodium chloride, and in one series the average of 16 fragments
was 0&middot;13%. But the percentage of sodium chloride has
often been found higher, more especially in larger objects of
baked clay, being in one instance as high as 2&middot;3%. The
disintegration of the surface is due to the mechanical action
of moisture which results in the scaling off of portions of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6' href='#Page_6'>
[6]</a></span>
surface. This does not however exclude a chemical action of
the salts upon the clay, especially when this has been only
slightly baked. Thus by merely washing such fragments in
cold distilled water, not only sodium and magnesium compounds
but also those of aluminium and calcium may be
removed. The soft powdery patches, which some limestones
show instead of scales, are also evidences of chemical action;
thus in one case a cuneiform tablet<a name='FA_6' id='FA_6'
href='#FN_6' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> of dolomitic stone
showed decomposition at those spots where the salt was
firmly deposited as an incrustation, and here the stone,
elsewhere smooth and hard, was found, on washing away
the salt, to be soft and porous.

<p>
Although, as has been already remarked, sodium chloride
generally constitutes the bulk of the salts present, and only
in rare cases, as I have for instance shown in an Egyptian
Fayence and in several Greek clay vases, is the amount of
sulphates greater, yet there are in collections clay objects (Fig.
<a href="#Fig_5">5</a>)
covered with needles of sodium nitrate<a name='FA_7' id='FA_7'

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7' href='#Page_7'>
[7]</a></span>
the nitric acid has been contributed by the decomposition of
organic substances; and here the presence of nitrates proves
inimical to antiquities just in the same way as a coating of
limewash may be seen to be destroyed by the so-called
wall-saltpetre<a name='FA_8' id='FA_8' href='#FN_8' class='fnanchor'>

<h3>
<span class='smcap'>Iron.</span>
</h3>

<p>
If in some cases it may be uncertain whether the destruction
of antiquities of limestone or earthenware has been due
to mechanical or to chemical influences, this uncertainty
is excluded in the case of metallic objects, of which those
of bronze and iron chiefly come under the notice of the
antiquary.
</p>

<p>
From the first piece of metallic iron which he possessed
man must have soon become acquainted with its untoward
property of rusting, but even at the present day opinions differ
as to the origin of rust, and the cause of its rapid spreading.
It has long been known with certainty that iron containing
but little carbon (wrought iron) rusts with greater ease than
iron which is rich in carbon (cast iron or steel), and that the
rust is a compound of iron with hydrogen and oxygen
(hydroxide). That rust is of variable composition may be
inferred from the variations of shade from yellow to dark
brown which are met with.
</p>

<p>
Widely different views are held on the question of the
production of rust. Some<a name='FA_9' id='FA_9' href='#FN_9'
class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> maintain that iron rusts only in
the presence of water containing free oxygen and carbonic
acid (CO<sub>2</sub>) in solution, a ferrous bicarbonate being first
formed; the bicarbonate is then converted into ferrous carbonate,
which finally yields the hydrate with evolution of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8' href='#Page_8'>
[8]</a></span>
carbonic acid. This carbonic acid continues to attack further
areas of metallic iron. Others<a name='FA_10' id='FA_10' href='#FN_10'
class='fnanchor'>[10]</a> maintain that, while the
formation of rust <i>may</i> proceed as described, carbonic acid is
not necessary, and that free oxygen <i>alone</i> causes rusting when
atmospheric moisture is condensed upon the surface of iron.
That iron remains free from rust when in a solution of caustic
potash or soda is said to be due to the absence of free oxygen
and not to the removal of carbonic acid. Spennrath holds,
in opposition to the opinion of Axel Krefting<a name='FA_11' id='FA_11'
href='#FN_11' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a>, that rust once
formed cannot act as an oxidising agent, except by virtue of
its power of condensing water and retaining it in its pores.
Similarly E. Simon finds the chief cause of the corroding
action of rust in the property of absorption, that is surface-condensation
of gases. This condition is comparable to that
of liquefaction, and produces rapid chemical action. Under
certain circumstances ferrous hydrate is formed instead of ferric
hydrate, particularly when iron is subjected to vibrations,
as Tolomei<a name='FA_12' id='FA_12' href='#FN_12' class='fnanchor'>
[12]</a> has observed in iron rails etc. Stapff<a name='FA_13' id='FA_13' href='#FN_13' class='fnanchor'>[13]</a> believes
that mixtures of ferric hydrate with ferroso-ferric oxide,
which possess a similar composition to forge scale, are
formed under the influence of thermal waters. According to
Irvine<a name='FA_14' id='FA_14' href='#FN_14' class='fnanchor'>[14]</a>
rusting proceeds rapidly when two kinds of iron, such
as cast and wrought, are in contact, since their electro-chemical
relations may result in a voltaic couple. The electric
current brings about the decomposition of the water, and the
evolved hydrogen, being in the nascent state, combines with
the nitrogen dissolved in the water to form ammonia, as had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9' href='#Page_9'>[9]
</a></span>
been previously observed by Akermann<a name='FA_15' id='FA_15'
href='#FN_15' class='fnanchor'>[15]</a>. Similarly, electric
currents are said to be caused by the contact of ferroso-ferric
oxide with metallic iron, thus causing a further oxidation of
the iron<a name='FA_16' id='FA_16' href='#FN_16' class='fnanchor'>[16]</a>.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10' href='#Page_10'>[10]
</a></span>
The presence of certain neutral salts, especially sodium
chloride (common salt), has a very marked influence on the
destruction of iron<a name='FA_17' id='FA_17' href='#FN_17'
class='fnanchor'>[17]</a>.
</p>

<p>
When iron filings are exposed to air and moisture, oxidation
takes place; the action is, however, according to Krefting,
far more intense in the presence of an alkaline chloride. A
mixture of iron filings and sodium chloride exposed to moisture
is converted in a few days into a black powder which has
the following composition:&mdash;11&middot;4% FeO, 80&middot;0%
Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
8&middot;6% H<sub>2</sub>O, thus resembling the &ldquo;iron-black&rdquo; of Lemery;
on extraction with water the filtrate is found to be alkaline
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11' href='#Page_11'>[11]
</a></span>
and to possess a tallow-like smell<a name='FA_18' id='FA_18'
href='#FN_18' class='fnanchor'>[18]</a>. Without entering further
into Krefting&rsquo;s researches, we will quote the hypothesis with
which he concludes:
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
&ldquo;The iron probably combines with small quantities
of chlorine from the sodium chloride, causing alternate
reduction and oxidation, and this, owing to the ease with
which iron salts pass from one stage of oxidation to
another, very soon gives a visible result in the formation
of rust:
</p>


<p class="chem-eq">
Fe + 2NaCl = FeCl<sub>2</sub> + 2Na<br />
2Na + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = 2NaOH + H<sub>2</sub>.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
If these results be compared with observations made upon
the condition of iron objects which have been excavated, it is
evident that these are in many cases exposed to the action of
the air to a lesser extent while buried, and that their decomposition
will advance more rapidly when they have been
withdrawn from their protective covering of earth. The
condition of the objects differs according to the kind of iron,
the length of time during which they have been buried, and
the character of the soil in which they are found. In one
place objects are found covered with a slight layer of rust only,
in another with a thicker layer, in another there remains but
a small core of metal, or even none at all, or the layer of rust
may be intermingled with particles of earth or clay. The
rust may be uniform in colour and hardness in one case, and
in another soft areas, generally light in colour, may alternate
with darker, harder patches, while frequently the harder layer
is found below the lighter and softer, etc.&mdash;conditions which
depend on the occurrence of the various iron compounds. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12' href='#Page_12'>
[12]</a></span>
behaviour of all, however, when placed in collections, even in
the driest of rooms, is the same; all sooner or later undergo
change, and portions of rust become detached, until in the
course of time every trace of the original metallic core is
oxidised. A closer inspection generally shows in these cases
small brownish, glistening bubbles<a name='FA_19' id='FA_19'
href='#FN_19' class='fnanchor'>[19]</a> which prove, when touched,
to be drops consisting of chlorine compounds of iron surrounded
and permeated with oxides. Krefting<a name='FA_20' id='FA_20'
href='#FN_20' class='fnanchor'>[20]</a> gives as the average
of a series of analyses of the rust on northern antiquities the
following composition:
</p>

<p>
Thus the chief part in this rapid decomposition is played
by the chlorine compounds, as indeed was previously determined<a
name='FA_21' id='FA_21' href='#FN_21' class='fnanchor'>[21]</a>
by the experimental proofs already given. If ferrous
chloride is present the further decompositions can be explained
by such equations as those given by Olshausen<a name='FA_22' id='FA_22'
href='#FN_22' class='fnanchor'>[22]</a>.
</p>

<p class="chem-eq">
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13' href='#Page_13'>
[13]</a></span>

6FeCl<sub>2</sub> + 3O = Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> +
2Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>;<br />
2Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> + 2Fe = 6FeCl<sub>2</sub>.

</p>

<p class="noi">
The equations do not claim to give a complete statement of the
reactions, for other reactions take place at the same time;
thus ferric hydrates and carbonates and perhaps also intermediate
compounds of oxygen and chlorine occur; they show
however that in the oxidation of ferrous chloride, oxides and
ferric chloride are produced, so that new and hitherto intact
particles of the metal continually react with the ferric chloride.
</p>

<p>
In many cases the action of the chlorine is not only seen
in objects placed in a collection, but also in freshly excavated
objects. Not infrequently iron objects are found which are
covered with large hard blisters, and are thus more or less
deformed. The interior of these blisters consists of a mixture
of ferrous chloride with oxides, but the shell has become so
hard by complete oxidation that it can only be removed with
hammer and chisel.
</p>

<p>
Iron objects found in peat differ from these chlorine-containing
specimens which are found in soil, and although
sometimes much corroded, many are well preserved. Blell<a name='FA_23'
id='FA_23' href='#FN_23' class='fnanchor'>[23]</a> is
of the opinion that if peat is free from tannic acid, the
finds will be well preserved, while the theory advanced in the
Merkbuch<a name='FA_24' id='FA_24' href='#FN_24' class='fnanchor'>[24]</a> is that tannic acid acts as a preservative. The
latter view is probably the more correct, for although ordinary
tannic acid seldom occurs in peat, yet peat contains a series of
compounds which are tanning agents, such as ulmic, humic,
and crenic acids. These form iron compounds which, being
insoluble in water, protect the metallic iron beneath from
further action. If, however, the peat contains sulphates, and
especially if it contains free sulphuric acid, only much corroded
iron is likely to be found. Moreover the physical condition
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14' href='#Page_14'>
[14]</a></span>
of the peat may vary; thus it may be dry or damp or even
submerged under water, and this variation will exercise some
influence upon the condition of the iron.
</p>

<p>
Iron objects which are covered with the black, so-called
&ldquo;noble&rdquo; rust (Edel-rost) usually prove very stable. This,
like forge-scale, is a ferroso-ferric compound in which there is
a preponderance of ferrous oxide where it is in contact with
the metallic iron, and of ferric oxide in the outer layer.
&ldquo;Noble&rdquo; rust is probably in nearly all instances the result of
the action of fire, which may have been used in funeral rites,
or may have been accidental; very rarely can it have been
produced by the reactions mentioned above, as has been
suggested by Stapff.
</p>

<p>
Iron which has been in contact with the bone ash of burnt
corpses has certain characteristics. When entirely surrounded
with bone ash objects are well preserved<a name='FA_25' id='FA_25'
href='#FN_25' class='fnanchor'>[25]</a>, and only covered
with a thin layer of oxide. How far the ash has acted as a
preservative, I will not hazard an opinion, having seen but
few specimens, and these had been already varnished to
preserve them.
</p>

<p>
Under certain conditions the phosphoric acid of the bones
forms a thin bluish layer of iron phosphate, corresponding in
composition to vivianite
(Fe<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>.8H<sub>2</sub>O), as was
pointed out
by Jacobi in a series of objects in the Saalburg Museum at
Homburg. These objects also are quite durable.
</p>

<p>
In earth so full of sodium chloride as is that of Egypt,
objects of iron will be readily corroded, and the explanation
given above will account for the paucity of iron remains of
Egyptian origin. It is difficult, however, to find a satisfactory
explanation for the fact that objects found in sea-water are
specially well preserved. It may be that, in spite of the
presence of free oxygen in solution in the water their complete
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15' href='#Page_15'>
[15]</a></span>
insulation from the atmospheric air has resulted in the preservation
of the objects, as is the case with those which have
lain in a stream of fresh water.
</p>


<h3>
<span class='smcap'>Bronze and Copper.</span>
</h3>

<p>
Copper and its alloys are subject to the same far-reaching
changes as iron, but the action is less rapid. Bronzes of
widely different composition have to be dealt with to ensure
their preservation, and to a less extent, copper also<a name='FA_26'
id='FA_26' href='#FN_26' class='fnanchor'>[26]</a>.
According to von Fellenberg<a name='FA_27' id='FA_27' href='#FN_27'
class='fnanchor'>[27]</a> bronze objects may be classified
according to the material in which they have been found, i.e.
peat mud, water, or earth.
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
&ldquo;(1) Bronzes from peat mud are covered with a black
earthy mass, which can be easily removed by water and
brushes, the alloy then assumes its metallic lustre and
the characteristic colour of bronze. The complete preservation
of the pure metallic surface of the bronzes, in
the same condition as they were when they were submerged,
is easily accounted for by the enclosure of the
metal in mud of organic origin under several feet of
water which effectually excludes the oxygen of the air.
</p>

<p>
(2) The bronzes found in water, as for example in
the beds of lakes and rivers, are less perfectly preserved.
They have usually a thin coating of a calcareous deposit,
which however often allows the lustre and colour of the
metal to appear in places. When such bronzes have
dark or green coloured patches or spots, the layer is very
thin and may be removed by treatment with acids, which
allows the metallic colour to become visible. Bronzes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16' href='#Page_16'>
[16]</a></span>
preserved in water still retain the same definite edges and
points which they possessed when they entered the water.
If bronzes which are markedly incrusted with verdigris
are found in water in all probability they had lain in the
ground a considerable time before being covered with
water, and oxidation had penetrated deeply into the
metal before immersion.
</p>

<p>
(3) Bronzes found in the earth or in graves appear
covered with a fine green crust of verdigris which may be
either light or dark in colour and which often has a
vitreous lustre. This is generally known as Patina.
</p>

<p>
This crust varies in thickness from that of writing-paper
to several millimetres. If the green crust be filed
away, or better, removed by dilute nitric or sulphuric
acid, the bronze is found to possess a reddish colour;
below the crust of cupric carbonate is found a layer of
cuprous oxide, which may be removed by ammonia, thus
revealing the metal with its characteristic colour and
lustre. This condition is characteristic of the slow
oxidation of bronze in moist earth. The layer of cuprous
oxide between the pure metal and the external crust of
copper carbonate has been shown by the examination
made by Dr Wibel to be a product of the reduction of
copper carbonate by the metallic copper of the bronze.
Bronzes belonging to this category have often lost their
former metallic properties, and if of small diameter have
often been completely converted into cuprous oxide,
surrounded by a lustrous green or blue crust of
carbonates. If a metallic core remains, it is found to be
crystalline, brittle, and non-coherent, that is, it flies to
pieces under the blow of a hammer. Fine ornamentation
and sharpness, whether of edge or of point, have often
disappeared. This does not occur with bronzes preserved
in water.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17' href='#Page_17'>
[17]</a></span>
In another volume of the series<a name='FA_28' id='FA_28' href='#FN_28'
class='fnanchor'>[28]</a> von Fellenberg states
that basic copper chloride occurs as a constituent of
patina.
</p>

<p>
A few lengthier quotations may be conveniently given here,
in part verbatim, in part abstracted from literature which is
not readily accessible.
</p>

<p>
Reuss<a name='FA_29' id='FA_29' href='#FN_29' class='fnanchor'>[29]</a>
states that it has been hitherto generally assumed
that copper is first converted into cuprous oxide which is then
converted into a green hydrated oxy-carbonate which is
separated from the metal by a thin layer of cuprous oxide.
The specimens examined by him, however, showed no such
dividing layer, the metal being either directly in contact with
the malachite<a name='FA_30' id='FA_30' href='#FN_30' class='fnanchor'>
[30]</a>, or else separated from it by a black or bluish
layer of cupric oxide. He further draws attention to the
occurrence of irregular knobs two to three lines in height
which consist, in part, of azurite<a name='FA_31' id='FA_31'
href='#FN_31' class='fnanchor'>[31]</a>. Neither oxides of tin nor
chlorine were found. The alteration of the bronze he explains
by the prolonged oxidising action of water containing carbonic
acid.
</p>

<p>
In an exhaustive memoir Wibel<a name='FA_32' id='FA_32' href='#FN_32'
class='fnanchor'>[32]</a> describes the various
kinds of patina as malachite, copper-oxychloride, and azurite,
with admixtures of tin oxide, silver, iron oxide, lead chloride
and copper chloride. He discusses also the occurrence of
the cuprous oxide layer which is said to have been described
by Sage as early as 1779. After detailing the observations of
Davy, H&uuml;nefeld, and Picht, that the metallic copper exists
partly in alloy and partly free as crystals in the layer of
cuprous oxide, he continues as follows<a name='FA_33' id='FA_33'
href='#FN_33' class='fnanchor'>[33]</a>:
</p>

<div class="blkquot">
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18' href='#Page_18'>
[18]</a></span>

&ldquo;The process of decomposition in bronzes has been
regarded as a slow oxidation, in which cuprous oxide
marks the first and incomplete stage, while the carbonates
represent the later completed phase. The formation of
both these substances was assumed to be due to moist
oxidation, on bronzes as well as in those superpositions of
copper, cuprite, and malachite, so frequently found in
minerals. Indeed, no other process of formation of the
carbonates is conceivable; moreover cupric oxide, if
really present, would be naturally regarded as a product
of oxidation. The other substances, such as tin oxide,
which are occasionally found, would be produced in part
by similar simple processes, in part by the simultaneous
action of particular salts, the chlorine compounds, for
instance, by the presence of water containing sodium
chloride. Similarly the production of cuprous oxide was
usually attributed to an incomplete oxidation of the copper,
although it might very well be the result of an inverse
process, viz. the reduction of pre-existing cupric oxide.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
From the following considerations Wibel thinks
that he is justified in his assumption that the layer of
cuprous oxide is the result of reduction. Firstly, by no
means all bronzes which have been dug up, even though
from the same excavation, show the layer of cuprous
oxide. Secondly, the cuprous oxide layer is in the
crystallized state. Thirdly, &lsquo;all the facts of chemistry
show that the formation of cuprous oxide can only take
place by reduction, given the ordinary conditions of
temperature and pressure.&rsquo; Finally, in addition to
oxygen and carbonic acid, many salts, those of ammonia
for example, occur in the spots where bronzes are found
and favour the formation of copper salts. Wibel also
quotes in support of his views the experiment of Bucholz<a name='FA_34'
id='FA_34' href='#FN_34' class='fnanchor'>[34]</a>,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19' href='#Page_19'>
[19]</a></span>
that a strip of copper, the upper half of which is immersed
in a layer of distilled water, and the lower half in a concentrated
neutral solution of copper nitrate carefully poured
beneath it, becomes coated with copper and cuprous oxide.
</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">
He continues:
</p>


<p class="blkquot">
&ldquo;Bronze objects are attacked by waters which contain
oxygen, carbonic acid and a greater or less percentage of
salts. Such soluble salts as are formed are removed by
solution, while the bronzes become covered, according to
circumstances, with an insoluble layer either of carbonate
or of oxide, whereby the form of the objects is preserved.
The water then penetrates by capillary action through
the porous coating into the interior, and attacks further
portions of the metal, forming a layer of soluble cupric
salt; a portion of which is able to pass by diffusion
through the external layer. For the same reasons the
liquid, bounded as it is on one side by the metal and
on the other by the almost insoluble crust, shows varying
degrees of concentration: thus all the conditions necessary
for the Bucholz process are fulfilled. If the water
is rich in salts, a concentrated copper solution is formed
and even metallic copper may be deposited from it (i.e.
the &lsquo;copper crystals&rsquo; of bronzes); but if, as is usually
the case, the water contains only small quantities of
salt, cuprous oxide crystals only are formed. The fact
that the process takes place chiefly in the pores made
by the water itself is readily understood, because of
the comparative quiescence of the liquid; and that it
causes a marked progressive change in the object arises
from the continual exchange of a portion of the copper
solution already formed with fresh solvent from outside.
Where the absence of carbonic acid or other circumstances
hinder the formation of an almost insoluble crust, the
reactions detailed above may, under favourable conditions,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20' href='#Page_20'>
[20]</a></span>
take place directly upon the surface of the bronze;
if, on the other hand, there is a too rapid change of
liquid (as for example in very wet localities), the process
may altogether fail to set in, since the necessary conditions
of rest, etc. are wanting. Since the absence of
the necessary conditions may arise from a number of
purely accidental causes, it will be easily understood,
that bronzes from one and the same grave may show the
same percentage of carbonates, but very dissimilar percentages
of cuprous oxide. In short all actually observed
conditions in which bronzes are found are accounted for
by the explanations given above.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The following extract is taken from the section dealing
with patina in Bibra&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bronzes and Copper Alloys<a name='FA_35'
id='FA_35' href='#FN_35' class='fnanchor'>[35]</a>&rdquo;:
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
&ldquo;The conditions under which Patina is formed, or
rather the conditions under which copper alloys are
gradually decomposed, are variable in the extreme. The
four main factors which may be instrumental in determining
the chemical changes may be thus stated:
</p>



<p>
(<i>a</i>)  The composition (qualitative and quantitative)
of the particular alloys.
</p>

<p>
(<i>b</i>)  The mode of smelting and the original manipulation
of the components, such as a good or poor
mixing, fine or coarse grain, etc.
</p>

<p>
(<i>c</i>)  The locality in which the alloy has lain.
</p>

<p>
(<i>d</i>)  The length of time during which the alloy has
been exposed to the particular conditions.... Marked
differences may appear in the extent and nature of the
chemical changes shown by the same alloy; thus one
fragment while underground may have been enclosed in
an urn containing bone ash and dry sand, while another
fragment may have been in contact with decaying animal
matter.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21' href='#Page_21'>
[21]</a></span>
From what has been said above, the variations in the
composition of patina may be readily explained. The composition
has been found to be:
</p>



<p class="in">
(&#945;) Basic carbonate of copper.
</p>

<p class="in">
(&#946;) Basic carbonate and sulphide of copper.
</p>

<p class="in">
(&#947;) Malachite (normal carbonate of copper), with
occasional admixture of cuprous oxide and azurite (acid
carbonate of copper) [Stolba].
</p>

<p class="in">
(&#948;) Crystalline cuprous oxide, according to Wibel<a name='FA_36'
id='FA_36' href='#FN_36' class='fnanchor'>[36]</a> a
reduction product of the carbonate of copper, by the action of
the copper of the bronze.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, copper chloride has been occasionally found in
patina [Haidinger]<a name='FA_37' id='FA_37' href='#FN_37'
class='fnanchor'>[37]</a>. This is only to be expected from the
varying character of the localities in which the statues or
bronzes are found. The author has himself noticed on
board ship, how objects of copper and brass, which are
exposed to the salt spray, develop a durable coating of copper
oxychloride<a name='FA_38' id='FA_38' href='#FN_38' class='fnanchor'>
[38]</a> (atacamite).
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, reference may be made to a statement of
Chevreul<a name='FA_39' id='FA_39' href='#FN_39' class='fnanchor'>
[39]</a>, who, after examination of both hollow and solid
specimens of Egyptian statuettes, states that the bronze is of
an excellent quality and that it occurs in four different conditions.
He describes these four conditions, three of which
are undoubtedly patina or altered copper, as follows:
</p>



<p>
(&#945;) A green deposit with patches of blue.
</p>

<p>
(&#946;) A blood-red mass.
</p>

<p>
(&#947;) A reddish coloured bronze.
</p>

<p>
(&#948;) Ordinary bronze unaltered in appearance.
</p>


<p>
The first in this category represents the ultimate stage
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22' href='#Page_22'>
[22]</a></span>
of decomposition of bronze and forms the outer incrustation
of the statuettes. It is a compound of copper chloride and
copper oxide and water in the same proportions as in Peruvian
copper oxychloride (atacamite); the blue parts contain water,
carbonic acid and cupric oxide. It is in fact the blue
hydrated copper carbonate.
</p>



<p>
(&#946;) The blood-red substance consists chiefly of cuprous
oxide with an admixture of tin oxide. It contains chlorine,
apparently as cuprous chloride, sometimes in considerable
quantity.
</p>

<p>
(&#947;) The reddish colour seems to be due to the tin undergoing
more alteration in the course of time than the copper.
</p>

<p>
(&#948;) The well-preserved bronzes are remarkable for the
excellent quality of the alloy.
</p>

<p>
Chevreul continues:
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
&ldquo;Copper and tin have thus undergone gradual changes
from without inwards into chlorides, oxides and carbonates;
the tin has been converted into oxide, the outermost
layer of copper into oxide and chloride, while the layer in
contact with the unaltered bronze beneath can only be
oxidised into the suboxide.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
In a fissure in a statuette he found crystals of blue basic
carbonate of copper, chloride of lead and hydrated oxychloride
of copper.
</p>

<p>
Bibra himself examined the patina of several bronzes and
found it to consist mainly of sulphate and carbonate of
copper.
</p>

<p>
To complete the quotation from Chevreul&rsquo;s work we
may observe that he finds the cause of the formation of the
patina to be the action of air, of water containing salt, and
of carbonic acid. It is interesting that Chevreul succeeded in
restoring a small bronze containing chlorine by reduction in a
stream of hydrogen.

So too at a meeting of the Association for the Promotion
of Industries in Prussia, Elster<a name='FA_41' id='FA_41' href='#FN_41'
class='fnanchor'>[41]</a> referred to the existence of
chlorine in patina, and regarded this as a proof that the patina
upon antique bronzes was actually intentional on the part of
the manufacturers.
</p>

<p>
E. Priwoznik<a name='FA_42' id='FA_42' href='#FN_42' class='fnanchor'>
[42]</a> has described a rare kind of patina which
formed a coating 5 to 7 mm. in thickness composed of three
layers consisting of a reniform or botryoidal incrustation of
an indigo blue colour. The uppermost layer which was also
the thickest consisted of 33&middot;22% of sulphur and 66&middot;77% of
copper, and was therefore cupric sulphide, CuS (which is
known in the mineral world as Indigo Copper or Covelline).
The second layer, which existed only in patches, was 0&middot;5 mm.
in thickness and of a blackish colour; it consisted of cuprous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24' href='#Page_24'>
[24]</a></span>
sulphide, Cu<sub>2</sub>S with 15% of tin. The third layer which, like
the second, was incomplete, formed a fine black powder, and
consisted of 59&middot;8 Cu<sub>2</sub>S, 23&middot;2 Sn and 3&middot;4%
of water. The
patina had been produced by the action of soluble sulphides or
of sulphuretted hydrogen upon the copper, while the sulphur
compounds themselves had resulted from the decay of organic
matter in the soil in which the bronze was found.
</p>

<p>
Mitzopulos<a name='FA_43' id='FA_43' href='#FN_43' class='fnanchor'>
[43]</a> described the green patina of the copper alloys
found in Mycene as malachite and atacamite upon a reddish
layer of cuprous oxide.
</p>

<p>
Another analysis of patina was made by J. Schuler<a name='FA_44'
id='FA_44' href='#FN_44' class='fnanchor'>[44]</a>. The
bronze in question had a grey outer layer, which passed
gradually into a light green friable layer 2 mm. in thickness.
A detached portion of this layer of patina, dried in a desiccator
over concentrated sulphuric acid with a loss in weight of
9&middot;44%, gave the following analysis:

Schuler makes the following observations:
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
&ldquo;Whilst the percentage of copper in the alloy is high
(89&middot;78%) and the percentage of tin is low (6&middot;83%), the
percentage of copper in the patina (metallic copper
19&middot;84%) is smaller, that of tin (metallic tin 42&middot;67%)
considerably greater. The percentage of lead in the
patina has also slightly increased. One of the causes of
this alteration in the proportion of the metals may lie
in the fact that basic carbonate of copper is soluble in
water containing free carbonic acid, whilst tin hydrate is
insoluble. Another cause may be found in the action
of water which contains in solution ammonia and
ammonium carbonate produced by the decomposition of
organic matter. Confirmative evidence of this supposition
is the presence of small quantities of ammonia
in the patina<a name='FA_45' id='FA_45' href='#FN_45' class='fnanchor'>

Reference may be here made to an article by Mond and
Cuboni<a name='FA_50' id='FA_50' href='#FN_50' class='fnanchor'>[50]</a>
published in the Report of the Academy of Florence,
from which the following extract is taken:
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
&ldquo;By the terms &lsquo;rogna&rsquo; or &lsquo;caries&rsquo; of bronze, archaeologists
designate a peculiar change, to which ancient
bronzes, as statues, coins, vases, etc. are sometimes liable
when preserved in museums. This consists in a species
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28' href='#Page_28'>
[28]</a></span>
of efflorescence of light green colour at one or more points
upon the surface, which spreads by degrees, like oil over
a sheet of paper, destroying the surface and converting
the interior of the bronze into an amorphous whitish-green
powder. The rapidity with which this destruction
proceeds varies much according to circumstances which
are not yet sufficiently known. Sometimes the destructive
spot grows so slowly that it is hardly perceptible even
after some months; sometimes it grows very rapidly,
numerous spots form, spread, and unite, until in a few
months an ancient coin may be entirely destroyed. In
this way antiquities which are valuable for their history,
or for their workmanship, are sometimes more or less
injured by this development of patina, which archaeologists
regard as a plague in their collections.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
Mond and Cuboni believe that the growths above described
are caused by Bacteria. Although they have not succeeded
in producing the appearances of spreading patina by transference
of cultures of bacteria to intact bronzes they think
that their observations sufficiently support this supposition,
which they believe is further strengthened by the fact that
bronzes exposed for a quarter of an hour to a temperature
of 300&deg;F. (150&deg;C.), whereby any bacteria would be killed,
showed no further change after a period of six months. The
following is an extract from an article by Berthelot<a name='FA_51'
id='FA_51' href='#FN_51' class='fnanchor'>[51]</a>:
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
&ldquo;Copper objects, which have been buried in the earth
for several centuries, are found to be covered with a
green patina and with an earthy layer of varying thickness
which has the same colour. The metal itself is to
a greater or less depth converted into cuprous oxide.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29' href='#Page_29'>
[29]</a></span>
After removal the patina returns; in other words, the
metal shows further growths, and when in contact with
the atmosphere of our climate is in all cases by degrees
converted into dust. These facts are well known to
every collector and archaeologist, who designate the
specimens thus affected &lsquo;m&eacute;taux malades&rsquo;.... Analysis
shows that the superficial green layer consists in great
measure of atacamite (cuprous oxychloride) agreeing with
the formula 3CuO, CuCl<sub>2</sub>, 4H<sub>2</sub>O. There are also found
traces of sodium salts. The changes which have been
observed are produced by salts from the soil, especially
sodium chloride, held in solution by water. In fact a
few drops of salt water placed upon a copper plate are
sufficient for the formation of oxychloride.... This
reaction is the result of the simultaneous action of the
oxygen and of the carbonic acid of the air upon the
copper and upon the sodium chloride in the presence of
moisture, as is represented by the following equations:
</p>


<p class="chem-eq">
4Cu + 4O = 4CuO<br />
4CuO + 2NaCl + CO<sub>2</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O = 3CuO, CuCl<sub>2</sub>,
4H<sub>2</sub>O + Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.
</p>

<p>
Thus the continuous transposition which, under the
influence of a salt-containing water, often acting in large
volume, converts the metal into oxychloride, is readily
explicable: while the process whereby the small quantity
of sodium chloride originally present in an excavated
bronze may cause its destruction after it has been placed
in a museum is the following:
</p>

<p>
When the reactions given above have resulted in the
formation of a certain amount of copper oxychloride, it
is to be supposed that a small quantity of sodium chloride
comes into simultaneous contact with the oxychloride and
with the metallic copper. A slow reaction takes place
and a double compound of cuprous chloride and sodium
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30' href='#Page_30'>
[30]</a></span>
chloride is formed. The remaining portion of copper is
converted into cuprous oxide:
</p>


<p class="chem-eq">
3CuO, CuCl<sub>2</sub>, 4H<sub>2</sub>O + 4Cu + 2NaCl =
Cu<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, 2NaCl + 3Cu<sub>2</sub>O + 4H<sub>2</sub>O.
</p>

<p>
The solution of the double salt is also in turn oxidized
by the air which penetrates the whole mass. The result
of the reaction is therefore sodium chloride, atacamite,
and copper chloride:
</p>


<p class="chem-eq">
3Cu<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> + 3O + 4H<sub>2</sub>O = 3CuO,
CuCl<sub>2</sub>, 4H<sub>2</sub>O + 2CuCl<sub>2</sub>.
</p>

<p>
The copper chloride which remains, if in contact with
air and copper or even cuprous oxide, is similarly converted
into oxychloride:
</p>


<p class="chem-eq">
CuCl<sub>2</sub> + 3Cu + 3O + 4H<sub>2</sub>O = 3CuO, CuCl<sub>2</sub>,
4H<sub>2</sub>O.
</p>

<p>
The cycle is thus complete, and its constant recurrence
under the influence of oxygen and moisture is the cause
of the destruction of those objects containing copper
which are imbedded in earth, and even of those which
are preserved in our museums.&rdquo;

<p>
Finally a memoir by Villenoisy<a name='FA_52' id='FA_52' href='#FN_52'
class='fnanchor'>[52]</a> should be noticed, the
first portion of which is devoted to a proof that the patina of
ancient bronzes is due to natural causes and is not the result
of the art and methods of the metal-workers of the ancient
world. The second portion deals with the various kinds
of patina and their formation, as the following excerpts will
show:
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
The following substances may be mentioned as
capable of attacking alloys:&mdash;Ordinary oxygen, which
has but a slight action on copper in the dry state but a
more vigorous action in the presence of moisture, or as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31' href='#Page_31'>
[31]</a></span>
ozone; sulphur also, ammonia, carbonic acid, and organic
substances. Water has no direct influence, but acts as a
solvent. The metals or metalloids of the alloys can
unite independently with oxygen, sulphur, or carbonic
acid, etc. to form oxides, sulphides, or carbonates; or
again they can react among themselves and produce
copper stannate or lead stannate. Ammonia will form
ternary compounds or play a catalytic part. Whatever
processes may result in the formation of patina, the
changes which occur are too slow to allow their imitation
and examination in the laboratory. The four
metals which are found in ancient bronzes, viz. copper,
tin, zinc, and lead, are particularly liable to certain
changes. Copper forms chiefly cupric and cuprous oxides.
The first of these is soluble in ammonia; the latter
combines with ammonia to form a substance which is
colourless, but which becomes blue on exposure to air.
Tin forms stannic acid which probably produces stannates
with copper and lead. Zinc becomes zinc oxide, lead is
converted into oxides. Sulphur, as sulphuretted hydrogen,
causes the formation of metallic sulphides. Ammonia
has a threefold action, viz. it causes and furthers
hydration, it is an energetic solvent, and it forms double
salts. This last-mentioned action is particularly important
in the formation of patina. Carbonic acid in the presence
of moisture attacks copper, lead and iron, and, as a
carbonate, exists in every metallic oxide which is exposed
to the air. Several combinations of copper with carbonic
acid are known, while lead is readily converted into lead
carbonate by oxidation. The part played by the carbon
compounds resulting from the decomposition of animal
and vegetable substances has hitherto received little
attention, but this decomposition of organic material is
probably the chief cause of the beautiful blue patina.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32' href='#Page_32'>
[32]</a></span>
The action of oxygen will depend upon the composition
of the metal, upon the locality, and upon numerous other
circumstances, while the colour of the patina will vary
accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Villenoisy proposes to classify patina into three
groups:
</p>



<p>
(1) Blue patina, with grey to blue-green and
apple-green tints.
</p>

<p>
(2) Dark green patina.
</p>

<p>
(3) Black patina.
</p>

<p>
1. The blue patina produced by the action of ammonia
upon the products of previous oxidation does not
destroy the outer form of the bronzes, but is nevertheless
unfavourable to the preservation of the metal, since the
substratum of the patina is a porous mass, consisting of
lead stannate and lead carbonate mixed with ammoniacal
copper carbonate. The specimen has frequently an intact
appearance, as if covered with a thin layer of oxide only,
whilst in reality all traces of metal have already disappeared,
and slight pressure often suffices to break the
bronze into pieces. The nearer the colour of the patina
approaches to grey, the less solid is the bronze likely to
be, a result which is no doubt caused by the presence of
lead carbonate. This type of patina has often a yellowish
colour, especially on prominent parts, where, being porous,
it has retained in its superficial layers substances which
were in suspension in the subsoil water. The occurrence
of a pale fine-grained patina of a uniform colour is in
almost all cases due to the scaling off of patina belonging
to this type.
</p>

<p>
2.  Whilst blue patina is generally formed on bronzes
which have been buried in earth, the dark green patina
is formed both in the earth and also in the open air.
The presence of lead seems to be an obstacle to its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33' href='#Page_33'>
[33]</a></span>
formation. This dark green patina consists of variable
proportions of basic copper hydrate and copper carbonate.
The green layer frequently rests upon one of a red colour,
a circumstance which proves that the dark green patina
is almost always the result of two successive reactions:
cuprous oxide is first formed and subsequently takes up
water and carbonic acid. Tin is present as copper
stannate. The cuprous oxide, which is generally regarded
as unaffected by air, is perhaps drawn into further reaction
through the agency of ammonia. In those situations where
there is a flow of rain water a certain translucency of
the green patina is often produced, and this is also possibly
caused by ammonia. Unlike the blue patina, the dark
green variety assists the preservation of bronze.
</p>

<p>
3. Black patina is probably due to a variety of circumstances.
The substances which enter into its composition
are cupric oxide, lead oxide, lead peroxide, copper sulphide
and lead sulphide. If bronze does not contain lead it is
blackened only by the action of sulphur. The rarity of
black patina is no doubt due to the rapid oxidation of
the copper on the originally rough, unpolished surface,
which leads to the formation of a green patina.
</p>
</div>

<p>
These extracts show how little value can be attached to
a classification of bronzes from the character of the patina
present: the views upon the subject are so divergent, while
the actual composition of the incrustations which form the
patina and their external appearance are so widely different.
In fact only two groups of bronzes may be distinguished, i.e.
those which show patina and those from which patina is absent.
</p>

<p>
The first group comprises almost all the bronzes which are
found in peat, which show, with rare exceptions, a metallic,
often somewhat darkened, surface. Their state of preservation
depends upon the nature of the peat in which they are found,
but the metal surface has, in the majority of cases, become
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34' href='#Page_34'>
[34]</a></span>
somewhat rough and etched, although all the details are
clearly distinguishable. More rarely one side retains the
original polished surface while the other side is much corroded.
If a much corroded bronze is found, the peat in which it has
lain has probably contained free sulphuric acid (see also p.
<a href="#Page_13">13</a>).
All bronzes found in water must be included also in this
group. The second group will then comprise all bronzes with
an oxidized patina.
</p>

<p>
The classification given by Villenoisy seems entirely unsuitable,
for it does not by any means exhaust all the kinds
of patina which may occur. Thus no mention is made by him
of the frequent occurrence of a patina which contains chlorine.
If we separate the dark brown and the blackish patina, in so
far as these two colours are pure, from those of a green colour,
the first two varieties cannot be regarded as groups, because
the tones of colour differ too much, and because, as Villenoisy
himself observes, widely different patinas often occur on one
and the same bronze. The durability of a patina upon a
bronze cannot be judged either by the outer appearance or by
the chemical composition alone. The fact that there has been
no alteration in the outward appearance for many years offers
no guarantee against further changes taking place. Thus a
Minotaur<a name='FA_53' id='FA_53' href='#FN_53' class='fnanchor'>
[53]</a> in the Berlin Museum, which for many years had
shown no sign of change, was eventually found to be completely
covered with numerous bright green spots over its
entire surface. My own opinion is that the only patina
which is really stable is that which consists of combinations of
oxygen, hydrogen and carbonic acid with the metal, somewhat
similar to those analysed by Schuler (see page <a href="#Page_24">24</a>),
and by
Arche and Hassack (see page <a href="#Page_27">27</a>). The presence of
sulphides,
and even of sulphates, does not seem to be injurious.
</p>

<p>
If a patina is to deserve the name of a good, sound, or, as
it is termed, a &ldquo;noble&rdquo; patina (Edel-patina), the original
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35' href='#Page_35'>
[35]</a></span>
contours of the bronze with all its markings must be distinctly
visible. For this the patina must not be too thick,
must be of moderate hardness, and above all must have an
enamel-like surface. Apart from chemical influences, such a
patina can only have been formed in those cases in which the
alloy has been homogeneous, fine-grained, dense and not
porous, and when its surface has been so smooth that oxidation
has taken place very slowly. Under these conditions
the colour of the patina may vary greatly, for it may be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36' href='#Page_36'>
[36]</a></span>
bright green, blue, or of darker shades from yellowish to
brown, or even black. These latter tints often denote patina
layers of very slight thickness. My own observations confirm
Villenoisy's view that the brown and the black patina are for
the most part due to the presence of lead in the bronze.
Rein<a name='FA_54' id='FA_54' href='#FN_54' class='fnanchor'>[54]</a>
holds the same opinion in regard to Japanese bronzes.
</p>

<p>
Certain forms of patina are not necessarily prejudicial to
the preservation of bronzes, i.e. the green and blue varieties
which have the composition of malachite (CuCO<sub>3</sub>,
Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>)
and azurite (2CuCO<sub>3</sub>, Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>), both of which are
very often
found on the same bronze. This variety of patina shows a
crystalline structure. The simultaneous formation of both
varieties, which is due to the greater exposure of one part of
the bronze than another to the action of moisture, is well
shown by a specimen in the Berlin Museum<a name='FA_55' id='FA_55'
href='#FN_55' class='fnanchor'>[55]</a> (Fig. <a href="#Fig_6">6</a>). This
consists of the frontal portion of a Boeotian bridle, over parts
of which leather straps had probably been tightly fixed.
Those parts which had been thus somewhat protected from
moisture were covered with blue azurite, which contains a
smaller quantity of water. But the crystalline structure of
these kinds of patina has often the disadvantage that the
surface of the bronze is no longer clear, and consequently
engraved markings and even stamped impressions are not
visible. On page <a href="#Page_142">142</a> may be seen illustrations of
Roman
coins, some parts of which are totally illegible. More
frequently met with than these varieties or than the so-called
&ldquo;noble&rdquo; patina, is that in which the bronze presents a more or
less rough and pitted surface, light or dark green, or even grey
in colour if there is a large proportion of lead present. More
rarely the tint is blue or brown. The behaviour of such kinds
of patina varies greatly, but durability is for the most part
assured if, under the layer of green oxide, a reddish layer of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37' href='#Page_37'>
[37]</a></span>
cuprous oxide is found. This rule is perhaps not invariable,
for I have often found cuprous oxide present under the
so-called spreading patina, but absent beneath one which is
undoubtedly durable.

<p>
Two instances may be here quoted as confirming Wibel&rsquo;s
view in reference to the reduction of cupric oxides to cuprous
oxides and even to metallic copper (see page <a href="#Page_17">17</a>)<a
name='FA_56' id='FA_56' href='#FN_56' class='fnanchor'>[56]</a>. In
removing a sandy crust saturated with copper salts from a
large Egyptian bronze<a name='FA_57' id='FA_57' href='#FN_57'
class='fnanchor'>[57]</a>, small crystalline masses of copper
were seen here and there, separated from the metal beneath
by a layer of cuprous oxide to which the admixture of tin
gave a whitish tint. The copper was mostly deposited in
slight depressions upon the surface of the metal and could be
easily removed. Similarly, upon an Etruscan mirror exhibited
in the Berlin Museum<a name='FA_58' id='FA_58' href='#FN_58'
class='fnanchor'>[58]</a>, reduced copper can still be seen forming
red spots upon the lighter coloured surface of the bronze,
which has already been freed from cupric oxide. The copper
also can be removed with comparative ease, and is observed
to be separated from the bronze by a thin whitish layer of tin
oxide. A quantitative analysis of a small piece showed 100%
of copper.
</p>

<p>
As has been remarked above, the layers of oxide frequently
enclose grains of sand and even fragments of clay, earth, and
ferruginous particles, so that the original contours of the
bronzes are often indistinct or entirely obliterated (see Figures
<a href="#Fig_41">41</a>-<a href="#Fig_43">43</a>). These incrustations
may occasionally be removed by
a careful use of the hammer, but they are often so firmly
united with the bronze, which is itself so oxidized, that removal
by mechanical means is no longer possible.

A due consideration of these figures must lead to the
conclusion that as a rule a malignant patina is one which
contains chlorine. That traces of chlorine are found in many
cases of benign patina need cause no surprise, for frequent
handling alone may suffice to bring about such a condition.
Nor is this rule invalidated by the fact that a patina which
is proved to contain chlorine (e.g. that of the mirror<a name='FA_61'
id='FA_61' href='#FN_61' class='fnanchor'>[61]</a> depicted
on page <a href="#Page_40">40</a>), has remained unchanged for years under
certain
conditions, for the formation of patina depends upon various
causes, and it often happens that a bronze carries a patina
which outwardly seems to have stood the test of years, yet
internally oxidation has continued and becomes outwardly
visible only when some mechanical injury to the patina allows
variations of temperature to exert a greater influence. A
specimen is often regarded as bronze, whereas in reality it
does not even contain a metallic core, but consists merely of
cuprous oxide, copper oxychloride, tin oxide, etc.<a name='FA_62'
id='FA_62' href='#FN_62' class='fnanchor'>[62]</a>, and is
therefore incapable of further change. On the other hand it
is not surprising to find a patina, which, although containing
no chlorine, affords but a poor protection to the bronze, for
in this case the cause may lie in the non-homogeneous and
porous nature of the alloy.
</p>

<p>
This list shows in addition that this high chlorine-content
is a distinguishing feature of the patina of Egyptian bronzes,
as is only to be expected from the character of the Egyptian
soil (vide pp. <a href="#Page_1">1</a>, <a href="#Page_2">2</a> <i>et seq.</i>);
in fact, although in most cases
qualitatively only, I have proved the existence of chlorine in
each Egyptian bronze without an exception. The destructive
nature of chlorine is not often apparent in bronzes recently
excavated, which usually show an apparently sound, dark
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42' href='#Page_42'>
[42]</a></span>
green patina with a smooth surface, sometimes like malachite
or azurite; personally I have not met with any bronze object
from Egypt which could be said to have a patina deserving
the name of &ldquo;noble&rdquo; patina. Not till some time, or it
may be not till years after the objects have been placed in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43' href='#Page_43'>
[43]</a></span>
museums does the change become apparent, as has been so
strikingly described by Mond and Cuboni (see page <a href="#Page_27">27
</a>).
The varying amount of moisture in our atmosphere undoubtedly
influences the spread of the patina, which, if the
application of a preservative is delayed, gradually eats into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44' href='#Page_44'>
[44]</a></span>
the bronze. The adjoining figures (Fig. <a href="#Fig_9">9</a> to
<a href="#Fig_12">12</a>) of the same
bronze before and after the process of preservation show
distinctly such ravages, whereby the surface has been in some
places eroded to a depth of 2 to 3 mm. In other cases,
especially hollow bronzes, the thin walls have been completely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45' href='#Page_45'>
[45]</a></span>
perforated. The explanation of these processes is found in
the experimental work of Krefting<a name='FA_63' id='FA_63' href='#FN_63'
class='fnanchor'>[63]</a>, and also in the treatise
by Berthelot, from which extracts have already been given.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46' href='#Page_46'>
[46]</a></span>
The theory enunciated by Mond and Cuboni, that the &ldquo;wild&rdquo;
or spreading patina is due to the action of bacteria, cannot
now be maintained, for not only do chemical reactions give an
adequate explanation of the process, but these observers have
failed to transplant the bacteria; nor were the experiments of
Dr Stavenhagen, undertaken at our request, more successful.
That certain bacteria are capable of attacking metal, as for
example the metal lettering on books, is an established fact,
while the universal distribution of bacteria will naturally lead
to their presence upon bronzes and their patina. The application
of heat checks chemical change by driving off the
moisture, and therefore arrests the spread of a patina for
some time, until by penetrating the oxidized layer the moisture
and carbonic acid can again act upon the patina and the
underlying metal. As has been already stated in the passage
from Dingler&rsquo;s &ldquo;Polytechnic Journal&rdquo; quoted above, I have
observed the renewed formation of efflorescence upon a bronze
statuette which had been thus sterilised. This, it may be
urged, was a case of re-infection: it is, however, strange that
Mond and Cuboni do not refer to chlorine as a component of
the patina. The presence of chlorine may have been overlooked;
it cannot well have been absent, for in every case of
rodent patina I have found without exception chlorine in the
bright green efflorescences, whatever may have been the
original source of the bronze.

<p>
Nor am I able to endorse the statement of Friedel<a name='FA_65'
id='FA_65' href='#FN_65' class='fnanchor'>[65]</a> that a
spreading patina is characterised by a peculiar and disagreeable
smell, although some oxidized bronzes have a distinct
smell which it is not easy to describe.
</p>

<p>
The presence of chlorine is particularly dangerous to those
bronzes which consist of a casing of metal of variable thickness
around a core of sandy clay, the object of which has been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47' href='#Page_47'>[47]
</a></span>
to economize metal. These constitute an important class
amongst Egyptian bronzes. The chlorine often exists in the
core as sodium chloride, and can thus attack the metal from
both sides. Moreover, the structure of many Egyptian
statuettes of a later period is very porous and spongy, and
thus presents a large surface to destructive agencies. On
sawing through the support of an Osiris<a name='FA_66' id='FA_66'
href='#FN_66' class='fnanchor'>[66]</a> numerous small
bright spots were found, upon examination with a lens, to be
small pores filled with a salt solution. A few days later the
action of the carbonic acid had begun, and the bright spots of
moisture were represented by small green patches. The
following figures show the absorption of moisture and of
carbonic acid by this specimen and by another Osiris from the
Egyptian collection.

<p>
These figures show that in the first case the absorption of
carbonic acid, oxygen, and water proceeded at first slowly, but
more rapidly after three months, as was evidenced also by the
appearance of marked efflorescence on the oxidized surfaces.
The Osiris, which was more highly oxidized, showed a more
rapid increase in weight from the first. The increased action
after the heating was also manifest externally, for at the end
of a fortnight the bright green efflorescences had made their
appearance. In this case therefore the heating recommended
by Mond and Cuboni, so far from proving beneficial, actually
induced a more rapid decay.
</p>

<p>
The patina layer, as Schuler has also observed, often
contains a greater proportion of tin than does the alloy; a
result which is manifestly due to the solution and removal of
the copper salts by the subsoil water. The bright efflorescences
of an Egyptian statue of Buto<a name='FA_67' id='FA_67' href='#FN_67'
class='fnanchor'>[67]</a> contained 10&middot;49% of tin,
while the percentage in the metal itself was only 7&middot;66.
In certain circumstances it may even result that an object
which was originally composed of bronze is represented only
by tin oxide<a name='FA_68' id='FA_68' href='#FN_68' class='fnanchor'>
[68]</a>. The small proportion, and occasionally the complete
absence, of copper is the result of the action of ammonia
which may arise from the decomposition of dead bodies and of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49' href='#Page_49'>
[49]</a></span>
carbonic acid, both of which agents, with the help of oxygen,
attack the buried bronzes, and, dissolving the copper compounds
by the subsoil water, leave only the insoluble tin oxide.
</p>

<p>
Upon the whole the foregoing remarks upon bronzes are
equally applicable to objects of copper, which however appear
to possess a greater power of resistance to the destructive
action of carbonic acid and moisture, even where salt is
present. This is probably due to the fact that the absence of
tin and lead precludes any interaction between the compounds
of these metals and those of copper. Copper objects with a
sound so-called &ldquo;noble&rdquo; patina apparently do not occur.
</p>


<h3>
<span class='smcap'>Silver.</span>
</h3>

<p>
Unless alloyed with a large amount of copper, in which
case they show green efflorescences similar to those of bronzes,
silver objects are almost always covered with a layer of soft
silver chloride (horn-silver) of varying thickness, AgCl, or of
the harder silver subchloride, Ag<sub>2</sub>Cl; and when these compounds
form a thick layer, they often show a warty or more
rarely a cracked surface. If the layer of chloride is thin,
incised designs upon the silver will be visible both before and
after removal of the chloride. The two chlorine compounds
frequently appear together in distinct sharply defined layers of
different colours, that nearer the silver being the layer of subchloride.
This is especially well shown on fragments of silver
from the Hildesheim silver-find<a name='FA_69' id='FA_69' href='#FN_69'
class='fnanchor'>[69]</a>. Upon one fragment<a name='FA_70' id='FA_70'
href='#FN_70' class='fnanchor'>[70]</a> the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50' href='#Page_50'>
[50]</a></span>
layer of silver chloride was about twice as thick as that
of the silver subchloride. Being unable to separate them I
determined the silver and the chlorine of both layers together
with the following result:
</p>


<p class="center">
Silver 74&middot;52.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Chlorine 21&middot;90.
</p>

<p>
Now for 2AgCl, Ag<sub>2</sub>Cl 74&middot;52 silver would correspond to
18&middot;11 chlorine only, while for AgCl the proportions would be
74&middot;52 silver to 24&middot;15 chlorine. Since the specific weight of
silver subchloride is greater than that of silver chloride,
these figures prove that the subchloride is also present.
</p>

<p>
Between the metal and the silver chloride there is often a
thin powdery layer consisting of finely divided cupric oxide,
or silver sulphide, and occasionally of gold, if, as is frequently
the case, the silver is auriferous. The presence of gold may,
however, also point to the existence of gilding. The silver
chloride often shows a reddish or brown colour on the surface,
due probably, in some cases, to the adherence of minute
quantities of the earth in which it was found, but partly also
to the action of light upon the silver chloride.
</p>

<p>
Thin black layers upon silver, as also the so-called silver
tarnish, result from the formation of silver sulphide, from
contact with decaying organic substances which have contained
sulphur.
</p>

<p>
When placed in museums silver objects remain unaltered,
and no further chemical changes take place.
</p>

<p>
Any other changes which have been observed will be
gathered from the following extracts.
</p>

<p>
Church<a name='FA_71' id='FA_71' href='#FN_71' class='fnanchor'>[71]</a>
analysed a specimen of silver upon which two
layers were distinguishable. The outer semi-metallic layer
consisted of metallic silver, with traces of chloride, sulphide,
and iodide of silver, together with copper carbonate and a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51' href='#Page_51'>
[51]</a></span>
small quantity of gold; the inner layer, which was soft, grey
and powdery, had the following composition:
</p>

<table id="t10" summary='Composition of the Inner Layer of a Silver
Object'>
  <tr>
    <td>Silver</td>
    <td class="r">94&middot;69%</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Gold</td>
    <td class="r">0&middot;41%</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Antimony with traces of arsenic and bismuth</td>
    <td class="r">1&middot;21%</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
As the composition of the sound metallic core was identical,
it is evident that physical and molecular changes only had
taken place similar to those observed by Warrington<a name='FA_72'
id='FA_72' href='#FN_72' class='fnanchor'>[72]</a> as early
as 1843.
</p>

<p>
Silver objects found in Mycene are said by Mitzopulos<a name='FA_73'
id='FA_73' href='#FN_73' class='fnanchor'>[73]</a> to
show three layers, the outermost of which has a red colour
and is not markedly friable, consisting of silver oxide; the
second is tough and consists of silver chloride (horn-silver);
while the third, that next to the metal, is similar to the
outermost layer. Mitzopulos thinks that the chlorine must
have been brought by rain water, since there are neither sea
nor springs of water in the neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
Schertel<a name='FA_74' id='FA_74' href='#FN_74' class='fnanchor'>
[74]</a> distinguished two layers in fragments of silver
from the Hildesheim silver find, the outermost of which
proved to be silver chloride:
</p>


<table id="t11" summary='Composition of the Outer Layer of Silver
Fragments'>
<tr>
  <td>Silver</td>
  <td>75&middot;43% found, 75&middot;31% calculated for AgCl</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Chlorine&nbsp;</td>
  <td>24&middot;51% found, 24&middot;69% calculated for AgCl</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Beneath this layer was a very thin, almost black, brittle
layer of silver subchloride:
</p>


<table id="t12" summary='Composition of the Innter Layer of Silver
Fragments'>
<tr>
  <td>Silver</td>
  <td>87&middot;0% found, 85&middot;89% calculated</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Chlorine&nbsp;</td>
  <td>12&middot;8% found, 14&middot;11% calculated</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Between the metal and the latter layer was a small
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>
[52]</a></span>
quantity of dark powder, which Schertel recognized as gold.
He thinks that the layer of silver subchloride seems to
indicate that the water, which permeated the surrounding
clay, contained chlorides, and first converted the copper into
copper chloride; that the copper chloride together with the
silver then formed silver subchloride and cuprous chloride.
Should the subchloride again become chloride, it would be
able to attack the silver afresh. The slowness of the process,
when the silver and copper in association with it had been
converted into chlorine compounds, allowed the gold to be
deposited as a fine powder upon the intact metal.
</p>

<p>
A silver coin rolled out into a thin plate, after remaining
in a solution of common salt for six months, was found to
have lost 27&middot;7% of its copper, so that the plate became brittle,
especially in those parts where it was thinnest.
</p>

<p>
Bibra<a name='FA_75' id='FA_75' href='#FN_75' class='fnanchor'>[75]</a>
gives a similar explanation of the conversion into
silver chloride. He believes that the reddish colour which is
occasionally seen on silver at a fresh fracture must be due to
the presence of cuprous oxide.
</p>

<p>
The following extract is taken from the section which deals
with silver in the work of Berthelot<a name='FA_76' id='FA_76'
href='#FN_76' class='fnanchor'>[76]</a> previously quoted:
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
&ldquo;Silver chloride is for the most part produced by
the sodium chloride dissolved in the subsoil water, which
acts in conjunction with the oxygen and the carbonic
acid of the air:
</p>


<p class="chem-eq">
2Ag + O + (n + 2)NaCl + CO<sub>2</sub> = 2AgCl, nNaCl +
Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.
</p>

<p>
But this reaction differs from that which takes
place in the case of copper in that it does not proceed
continuously except in the presence of a considerable
quantity of salt water only, as for instance in the sea.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53' href='#Page_53'>
[53]</a></span>
In museums the alteration goes no further than corresponds
to the minute quantity of sodium chloride contained
in the object. On the other hand in an earth
which contains salts, the continued presence of water
can bring about a more or less marked change, and in
some cases even a stable silver subchloride may be
formed.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>


<h3>
<span class='smcap'>Lead.</span>
</h3>

<p>
Objects of lead have always a white appearance due to the
formation of lead carbonate, as has been already mentioned
above in connection with bronze. The carbonate is also often
mixed with oxide.
</p>


<h3>
<span class='smcap'>Tin.</span>
</h3>

<p>
Objects made of tin<a name='FA_77' id='FA_77' href='#FN_77'
class='fnanchor'>[77]</a> are frequently found in pile-dwellings
in a good state of preservation. They are, however, occasionally
covered with white or brown layers of hydrated tin
oxide, while in some cases oxidation has advanced so far that
no trace of metallic tin is left in the hard grey masses of oxide
which result.
</p>


<h3>
<span class='smcap'>Gold.</span>
</h3>

<p>
Gold is found to be unaltered, or there is at most a thin
layer of silver chloride, which is the result of the action
of sodium chloride upon the silver which the gold usually
contains. Gold objects often have a red coating, which has
been found to consist of ferric oxide, and is due to extraneous
deposits which have been fixed by the silver chloride. I have
not been able to prove the presence of gold chloride<a name='FA_78'
id='FA_78' href='#FN_78' class='fnanchor'>[78]</a>, and it
does not appear possible that water containing sodium chloride
can have the power of acting upon gold. If the ferric oxide
is removed mechanically, some of the gold will naturally be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54' href='#Page_54'>
[54]</a></span>
removed with it, and this can be readily ascertained on
analysis.
</p>

<p>
The degree of brittleness in objects of gold depends upon
the changes which have taken place in other metals, especially
silver, which are mixed with it.
</p>


<h3>
<span class='smcap'>Glass.</span>
</h3>

<p>
Ancient glass, which is for the most part lime-soda silicate,
exhibits a dull, rough surface with the well-known iridescence.
The alkali is removed from the glass by the action of moisture,
oxygen and carbonic acid, while the silicic acid remains in the
form of minute scales, which cause the iridescence by interference.
According to Bunsen the chemical action of the
gases of the atmosphere on glass is facilitated by the condensation
of water upon its surface; for the water thus
condensed absorbs large quantities of carbonic acid. In
certain circumstances almost the whole of the alkali is withdrawn
from the glass. An analysis of glass of this kind,
together with a discussion of the chemical reactions involved,
is given in Muspratt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Chemistry<a name='FA_79' id='FA_79' href='#FN_79'
class='fnanchor'>[79]</a>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Glass objects which are markedly iridescent undergo
gradual decay even under museum conditions; this is probably
due to the continued action of carbonic acid.
</p>


<h3>
<span class='smcap'>Organic Substances.</span>
</h3>

<p>
The changes which organic substances undergo are various;
thus, while leather becomes hard, papyrus becomes brittle.
Like all other organic material they may undergo those
destructive processes which are due to the growth of moulds
or to the agency of various bacteria. They are also liable to
be attacked by maggots, moths, and other insects. It is
unnecessary here to describe in detail these numerous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55' href='#Page_55'>
[55]</a></span>
and varied changes; a few special cases only need be
mentioned.
</p>

<p>
Acid peat, in which iron objects perish, is found to have a
good preservative action upon wool and horn, whilst vegetable
fibres are destroyed. On the other hand, in pile-dwellings
wool and horn substances have disappeared. Olshausen<a name='FA_80'
id='FA_80' href='#FN_80' class='fnanchor'>[80]</a>
thinks that animal fibre is destroyed by simple decay brought
about by the oxygen in solution in ordinary water, whilst in
peat the immense quantity of vegetable matter takes up the
oxygen which can therefore no longer serve for the oxidation
of wool and similar material.
</p>

<p>
Under certain circumstances woollen textures are found
to be remarkably well preserved in oak coffins, as may be seen
in the Museum at Copenhagen.
</p>

<p>
Bones, horn, and ivory show great variety in their behaviour,
which depends of course on the nature of their surroundings.
Thus for instance in acid peat sometimes the animal matter
only is preserved<a name='FA_81' id='FA_81' href='#FN_81'
class='fnanchor'>[81]</a>, while in graves, beyond a few remains of
tooth enamel, there is often nothing to show that they have
enclosed bodies. Burned bones are generally found to resist
decay, for the destruction of the animal matter leaves them no
longer liable to further decomposition<a name='FA_82' id='FA_82'
href='#FN_82' class='fnanchor'>[82]</a>.
</p>

<p>
Amber objects are well preserved in water or in peat, but
if they have lain in earth, they are darkened and often
friable.
</p>

<p>
If organic substances, such as wood, etc., have lain in the
immediate neighbourhood of oxidized bronze, and are thereby
saturated with copper compounds, they show a very good state
of preservation, which continues after they have been placed
in a collection. Similarly the remains of fabrics upon iron
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56' href='#Page_56'>
[56]</a></span>
objects, which are permeated with rust, are sometimes found
in good condition.
</p>

<p>
Objects imbedded in salt (sodium chloride) are in certain
circumstances found in a good state of preservation and continue
so, as is shown by the skins, leather and wooden articles
which are exhibited in the Salzburg Museum.
</p>

<p>
As a general rule absence of moisture in the earth is
essential for the preservation of organic substances, and is the
cause of the splendid condition in which objects of organic
material are found in Egypt.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57' href='#Page_57'>
[57]</a></span>
</p>




<h2>
PART II.<br />
THE PRESERVATION OF ANTIQUITIES.
</h2>


<p>
The object with which it is proposed to deal should first be
photographed, and from different sides if necessary; for the
external appearance is often changed during the process of
preservation, and it is advisable that a representation of the
specimen in its original condition should be kept in case any
injury should befall the object, which however rarely happens
if proper caution be observed. For this reason in the
Laboratory of the Royal Museums at Berlin all bronzes are
photographed before treatment, as also are all limestone
blocks. Thus the 125 blocks from the Grave-chamber of
Meten were each separately photographed. It is only in
certain cases that this rule is not observed, as for instance in
the case of the numerous Egyptian ostraca, i.e. fragments of
earthenware showing inscriptions which had been previously
copied.
</p>




<h2>
I. <span class='smcap'>Preservation of Objects composed of
Inorganic Substances.</span>
</h2>


<h3>
(<i>a</i>) <span class='smcap'>Limestone.</span>
</h3>

<p>
The method formerly employed for the preservation of
decaying and crumbling limestones was that of simple impregnation,
and this is still followed in some cases which will
be subsequently described. But as the active agents of
destruction are not removed by this method the result is not
always satisfactory, and an attempt is now made where
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58' href='#Page_58'>
[58]</a></span>
possible to remove those salts which are soluble in water,
especially the sodium chloride, by the simple process of
steeping in water.
</p>

<p>
If the presence of salt in a limestone is evidenced by a
crumbling surface, or by the taste when touched with the tip
of the tongue, the question will arise whether it will bear
steeping, or whether the destruction is so far advanced that,
on being placed in water, the limestone will fall to pieces.
</p>

<p>
If fractures or cracks can be actually seen in the stone,
steeping is contra-indicated, but if the condition is less manifest,
a preliminary test should be applied.
</p>

<p>
A large drop of water, e.g. about 25 cubic centimetre in
volume, should be placed on the surface of the stone, and any
changes which take place should be carefully noted. If the
drop is not absorbed by the stone, it may be due to a layer
of dust or to previous saturation with solutions of resin or
varnish. Dust may be removed with a moderately hard brush
or by rubbing with the finger, but if a limestone has been
previously saturated with a varnish solution it will not absorb
the water, and is therefore hardly suitable for this treatment.
If the drop is absorbed, an iron or a steel point, such as the
thick end of a medium-sized needle, should be used to ascertain
whether the limestone at the moistened spot shows the same
degree of hardness as elsewhere. If this is found to be the
case, especially if the pieces are of a large size, the test should
be repeated at other spots, including the back of the stone,
for a hardened layer on the front aspect may be the result
of former treatment. If the result of this examination is
satisfactory and no soluble colouring is observed on the limestone,
the process of steeping may be applied. If on the
other hand the moistened area has become softer, or has
become to any extent swollen, or if any colours which may be
present show signs of disappearance or fading, treatment with
water must be abandoned.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59' href='#Page_59'>
[59]</a></span>
The difference of behaviour is easily explained, for limestones
do not always consist of lime only, or, more correctly,
carbonate of lime (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), but often contain sand or clay,
and the greater the amount of clay the more readily the stone
softens or swells. Even when a limestone has borne this
preliminary test satisfactorily it should be carefully watched
for an hour or two after immersion and should be at once
removed from the water should any further changes appear.
</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Steeping.</span> The procedure to be observed is as
follows.
The rapidity with which the salts may be removed varies
directly with the quantity of water used in steeping. The
treatment of objects of small size presents no difficulties;
any vessel of glass, porcelain, or earthenware will serve the
purpose. Towards the end of the treatment distilled water
should be used, or in default of this, clean rain water should be
used in preference to that from a well. For larger objects (as,
for example, the large limestone blocks of the Meten Chamber
mentioned above, some of which were 1 metre in length and
<span class='nom'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='dem'>2</span> metre or more
in breadth and thickness), it is convenient
to use wooden tubs fitted with a tap in front to draw off the
water, and so tilted by means of stones placed underneath
that the tap may be at the lowest point. The objects should
not touch the bottom of the vessel. Smaller pieces may be
suspended or may be made to rest on glass rings or supports of
glass rods; while large objects should be laid on blocks of wood
so placed as to allow the tub to be cleaned when necessary
without removal of the blocks, the weight of which would
otherwise entail much labour. The blocks should be as near to
the surface of the water as possible, leaving a considerable
depth of water beneath, for the heavier salt-laden water sinks
to the bottom, thus bringing into contact with the limestone
water with a smaller salt-content. The length of the steeping
must depend upon the size and porosity of the limestone.
</p>

<p>
Under certain circumstances phenomena make their appearance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60' href='#Page_60'>
[60]</a></span>
which must not be neglected. Thus if the treatment
extends over a considerable length of time, the wooden tubs
should be provided with lids to prevent the access of light.
This was found indispensable in the treatment of the blocks
from the Meten Chamber when Berlin tap-water<a name='FA_83' id='FA_83'
href='#FN_83' class='fnanchor'>[83]</a> was used,
for when the tubs were open a large quantity of brown
hydrated ferric oxide appeared on the limestone, the roughness
of which rendered its removal an impossibility even
with brushes. This oxide is produced by various forms of
algae and bacteria which developed in such numbers that
the sides of the tubs were frequently covered with a layer
of slime, which under the microscope appeared as a confused
web of transparent threads<a name='FA_84' id='FA_84' href='#FN_84'
class='fnanchor'>[84]</a>. This was brushed off with soft
brushes at least once a fortnight, for the slimy covering
impeded the access of the water to the limestone. That
in this case the ferric oxide was the result of the action of
light was proved by the fact that only those blocks which
were placed near the windows were discoloured, and that
the discolouration was proportionate to the amount of light
which fell upon them<a name='FA_85' id='FA_85' href='#FN_85'
class='fnanchor'>[85]</a>. Again, after the treatment in the
covered tubs some of the blocks became so black that
they resembled blocks of coal rather than limestone. After
exposure to light for a day or two, especially when the water
had been drawn off, the discolouration disappeared without
leaving any traces. The colour was doubtless due to a minute
quantity of iron in the form of sulphide which, after oxidation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61' href='#Page_61'>
[61]</a></span>
in the air and light, became invisible upon the light yellow
limestone. Under these circumstances the presence of sulphuretted
hydrogen in the water, possibly produced by bacterial
action upon the sulphates, was attested by the characteristic
smell.
</p>

<p>
The enormous number of bacteria which develop in the
water constitute a great hindrance to the process of steeping,
and as to boil such a quantity of water as is required for these
large objects is out of the question, frequent changes of water
and frequent cleaning of the stone, wooden blocks, and tubs
are the only remedies.
</p>

<p>
<span class='smcap'>Examination of the Progress of the Steeping.</span> The
water should be changed at first daily, then by degrees every
two, three, or four days, later on weekly only, until finally
once a fortnight is sufficient. To ascertain the progress and
completion of the elimination the quantity of chlorine in the
wash-water may be determined by a simple method of
titration<a name='FA_86' id='FA_86' href='#FN_86' class='fnanchor'>
[86]</a>.
</p>

<p>
The following short explanation may be of use, and the
method is easily learnt. If a solution of silver nitrate is
poured into a solution of common salt (sodium chloride), a
white curdy precipitate is produced, a process which the
following equation will explain:
</p>


<p class="chem-eq">
NaCl + AgNO<sub>3</sub> = AgCl + NaNO<sub>3</sub>.
</p>

<p>
The white precipitate is the silver chloride, whilst the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62' href='#Page_62'>
[62]</a></span>
sodium nitrate which is produced at the same time remains in
solution and is therefore not visible. As always definite proportions
of the two substances, silver
nitrate and sodium chloride, react upon
one another, by the use of a solution
containing a known amount of silver nitrate
we can determine the amount of
salt, and hence of chlorine present. By
cautiously inclining a burette (Fig. <a href="#Fig_13">13</a>)
divided into tenths of cubic centimetres<a name='FA_87' id='FA_87'
href='#FN_87' class='fnanchor'>[87]</a>,
the silver solution should be dropped
into a beaker containing a definite
volume of the solution to be examined
for chlorine; the level of the silver
solution in the burette should be read
off before and after pouring out, and
the number of cubic centimetres of the
silver solution required to precipitate
the chlorine will thus be known.
</p>

<p><a id='Fig_13' name='Fig_13' href='#Fig_13'></a></p>

 Gay-Lussac&rsquo;s
Burette. <span class='nom'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='dem'>6</span> nat.
size.</p>
</div>

<p>
The process when carried out in this
manner has one defect, for it is necessary
to allow the precipitate to settle in
order to see clearly whether an additional
drop of the silver solution will
produce further precipitation, or whether
it will merely cloud the fluid; this
defect can, however, be remedied by
means of a so-called &ldquo;indicator.&rdquo; A
few drops of a concentrated solution
of neutral yellow potassium chromate
should be added to the fluid to be examined,
which is thereby coloured yellow;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63' href='#Page_63'>
[63]</a></span>
the solution is then shaken or stirred with a glass rod, while
the silver nitrate is dropped in. Every drop of the silver
solution will cause a red precipitate, the colour of which
however disappears on stirring so long as there is any chlorine
present; only when the silver solution has precipitated all the
chlorine does the red colour become permanent, and thus the
change of colour of the whole fluid from yellow to red shows
with exactness the complete precipitation of the chlorine.
For practical purposes all that is required is the so-called
decinormal silver solution, and from the number of cubic
centimetres of this solution which are required to precipitate
all the chlorine the total amount of chlorine present can be
readily calculated.
</p>

<p>
In steeping smaller objects before examination the whole
of the water should be well stirred with a glass rod or poured
two or three times from one vessel into another: 100, 50 or
25 cubic centimetres are then poured into a graduated glass or
drawn up into a pipette. The water should be drawn up by
suction slightly above the level of the mark upon the stem of
the pipette, the upper end of which is immediately closed
with the thumb. By slightly raising the thumb the water is
allowed to run off until its upper surface is exactly level with
the mark. The amount taken is then placed into a beaker
(for 100 cubic centimetres a beaker of 400 c.c. capacity should
be used), and, after the addition of a few drops of a solution
of potassium chromate, is examined by titration. In the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64' href='#Page_64'>
[64]</a></span>
treatment of large objects, for which tubs are required, the
necessary quantity of water may be drawn by means of a
long pipette from the bottom of the tub, where the quantity
of salt is always greatest, or through the tap at the bottom
of the tub (as was done with the blocks from the Meten
Chamber, in which case about 1 litre was drawn off into a
glass out of which 100 c.c. were taken for titration). To
obtain results which are comparable, care must be taken that
the object is always as nearly as possible in the same quantity
of water. After placing the larger blocks in the water, one
examination should be made during the first few days, when
the titration may require 20 c.c. or more of silver solution.
There is no need to examine for chlorine while the water is
being frequently changed: indeed, in order to economise the
silver solution, this need not be begun until the second month,
when the water is changed every fortnight.
</p>

<p>
As has been stated above, it is only necessary to read off
the number of cubic centimetres of the solution used in the
titration, for the decrease in these figures is a sufficient
indication of the progress of the operation, while the diminution
of the chlorine-content may be taken as an indication
of the simultaneous removal of the sulphates<a name='FA_88' id='FA_88'
href='#FN_88' class='fnanchor'>[88]</a>. In the treatment
of small objects in distilled water, the process may be
regarded as complete if the red colour is obtained on the
addition of from one to two drops (i.e. about <span class='nom'>1</span>
&frasl;<span class='dem'>10</span> to <span class='nom'>1</span>&frasl;
<span class='dem'>5</span> cubic
centimetre) of the silver solution. If, when tap-water is used,
and is being changed at intervals of a fortnight or a month,
the estimations give a constant result between 0&middot;6 and 1&middot;0,
the treatment need not be carried further.
</p>

<p>
The accompanying table shows the figures obtained from
three large blocks from the Meten Chamber. They represent
the number of cubic centimetres of decinormal silver solution
used for 100 c.c. of the water, which was changed every fortnight.

<p>
When repeated examinations gave a fairly constant result of
0&middot;7-0&middot;8 cubic centimetre the process was regarded as
complete,
for Berlin tap-water itself contains small quantities of chlorine
compounds, 100 c.c. requiring from 0&middot;4 to 0&middot;6 c.c. decinormal
silver solution. Before using the water from a well or from
waterworks, it should be examined to ascertain the number of
cubic centimetres of silver solution required to produce the
red colouration. As the amount of chlorine compounds in the
water may vary it is advisable to repeat the examination<a name='FA_89'
id='FA_89' href='#FN_89' class='fnanchor'>[89]</a>.
</p>

can be completely extracted from small pieces of limestone.

<p>
These figures show the numbers of the c.c. of silver
solution used for every 100 c.c. of the water, which was
changed after 1, 2, etc. days as shown above. After 9 to 11
days therefore the stones could be declared free from salt.
</p>

<p>
If the accuracy of the titration method be considered
unnecessary, either on account of the small number or size of
the objects to be treated, or for reasons of expense (the outlay
required is however very small), a solution of unknown strength
may be used. A comparison between the degree of turbidity
produced on mixing the silver nitrate solution with the tap-water,
and that produced with the wash-water, will enable the
progress of the operation to be gauged.
</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Advantages and Disadvantages.</span> Although steeping
removes the cause of decay, i.e. the salts contained in the
limestone, and although permanence may be considered as
certain, there are certainly some disadvantages connected with
the process, especially when the pieces, on account of their
size, must remain in the water for some length of time. Some
large and very thick blocks from the Meten Chamber required
to be soaked for more than a year.
</p>

<p>
The small quantity of carbonic acid which is always found
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67' href='#Page_67'>
[67]</a></span>
in water dissolves small quantities of calcium carbonate, thus
the sharp contours of prominent parts may become somewhat
rounded. Limestones which have developed fissures may, on
immersion, lose small portions which might otherwise have
remained attached, though probably for a while only. In
such cases it must be carefully noted from which block, and
from which part of it, the fragment has broken off, in order
that it may be replaced<a name='FA_90' id='FA_90' href='#FN_90'
class='fnanchor'>[90]</a>.
</p>

<p>
Limestones which are much cracked, or which are likely to
fall to pieces, should be wrapped round with gauze, or held
together with twine, before they are put in the water.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the permanent preservation of the object
some other smaller advantages of this method may be mentioned:
for example, the layer of dust which is often present
is removed and thus traces of colours may be brought
out by the steeping which had been concealed by it. Thus
certain remains of colour mentioned by Lepsius<a name='FA_91'
id='FA_91' href='#FN_91' class='fnanchor'>[91]</a> as being still
visible in his time upon some of the blocks from the Meten
Chamber were no longer visible when we took them in hand.
Moreover traces of green colouring which were visible after
the treatment in the eyes of a few large figures in relief were
probably evidence that colours had formerly been present.
</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Drying.</span> When the steeping is finished the
limestone is
taken out to be dried. Small objects may be placed upon a
glass ring, wooden tripod or some such appliance, which
admits air on all sides, and may thus be dried by the air only.
A piece of paper laid loosely over them will protect them
from dust. In winter a hot stove, or similar source of heat,
affords a satisfactory method of drying, but wet stones must
not of course be placed directly upon the hot iron stove plate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68' href='#Page_68'>
[68]</a></span>
lest spots of rust should be produced upon the stone. Large
blocks are preferably dried in drying chambers in which in
summer time a strong draught is obtained by opening windows
on opposite sides, and which in winter are strongly
heated and opened every now and then for a short time.
The limestones should be laid upon wooden blocks to allow air
to pass beneath them, while they must be guarded from dust
both above and at the sides with sheets of paper. Several
months are often required to dry large blocks completely.
</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Impregnation.</span> When limestones have been
completely
dried, especially if they are soft, it is often
advisable to impregnate them with one
or other of the impregnation agents. To
economize material, large objects may be
painted over once or twice with a solution
of the material chosen, but smaller objects
should be immersed in the solution until
air-bubbles are no longer formed. If there
is a supply of tap-water with sufficiently
good pressure, rapid and complete penetration
by the fluid can be ensured by
placing the object in a vessel containing
the necessary fluid under a bell glass, the
air from which is then exhausted by a
water air-pump<a name='FA_92' id='FA_92' href='#FN_92' class='fnanchor'>
[92]</a>. Figure <a href="#Fig_14">14</a> illustrates the
application of such an air-pump fixed to
the water-tap by means of an india-rubber
tube which is firmly bound with wire. An
india-rubber stopper perforated to admit a
glass tube is fixed in the top of the bell
glass, while the smooth ground edge and
the thick ground glass plate upon which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69' href='#Page_69'>
[69]</a></span>
it rests are smeared with grease or vaseline. The side tube
of the air-pump is connected with the interior of the bell
glass by an india-rubber tube which is sufficiently strong to
resist the pressure of the outer air, and thus when the tap is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>
[70]</a></span>
opened the pressure of the flow of water carries with it the air
from the bell glass with which the pump is connected. If the
water-tap is suddenly turned off when the air is exhausted the
pressure of the outer air will force the water into the bell and
cause it to mix with the solution of resin or varnish. To
prevent this, a stop-cock or valve should be inserted, or the
water-tap should not be turned off until the stopper of the
bell-glass has been cautiously raised. A second glass tube
provided with a stop-cock may be passed through the india-rubber
cork and connected with a manometer to measure the
progressive action of the pump (Figure <a href="#Fig_15">15</a>).
When air-bubbles
cease to come from the object under treatment, the glass tap
should be closed and the manometer removed, after which the
glass tap should be again opened and the water-tap closed<a name='FA_93'
id='FA_93' href='#FN_93' class='fnanchor'>[93]</a>.

If the object is of some length but not too thick, the bell-glass
may be fixed on a strong glass cylinder of a similar
diameter having a ground edge (Fig. <a href="#Fig_15">15</a>), into which
the object
and the impregnating solution are then placed.
</p>

<p>
The following solutions, amongst others, may be recommended
as suitable for impregnation:
</p>


<p>
(1)  Shellac dissolved in alcohol.
</p>

<p>
(2)  Solution of gum-dammar<a name='FA_94' id='FA_94' href='#FN_94'
class='fnanchor'>[94]</a>.
</p>

<div class="blkquot">
<p>
15 grammes of dammar are dissolved in 130
grammes of benzine, to which is added a solution
of 20 grammes of clarified poppy seed oil
in turpentine. If the solution becomes too thick
it should be diluted with benzine and a small
quantity of turpentine.
</p>
</div>


<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71' href='#Page_71'>
[71]</a></span>
(3)  Rice water or tapioca water<a name='FA_95' id='FA_95' href='#FN_95'
class='fnanchor'>[95]</a>.
</p>

<p>
(4)  Dilute size.
</p>

<p>
(5)  Waterglass solution.
</p>

<p>
(6)  Linseed oil dissolved in benzine.
</p>

<p>
(7)  Linseed varnish dissolved in 3 parts of benzine or
petroleum ether.
</p>

<p>
(8)  Solutions of stearine or paraffin wax in benzine.
</p>

<p>
(9)  Collodion (free from acid). Zapon<a name='FA_96' id='FA_96'
href='#FN_96' class='fnanchor'>[96]</a>.
</p>

<p>
(10) Kessler&rsquo;s fluate.
</p>


<p>
It may be added that, as a general rule, solutions for this
purpose must be used as dilute as possible, for two immersions
in a dilute solution are preferable to a single soaking in a
concentrated one, which often scarcely penetrates into the
pores.
</p>

<p>
As the preparation of solutions of shellac, gum-dammar,
and of such substances as resin, stearine, and paraffin, necessitates
heating, and as the solvents are very inflammable, it
is advisable to make use of the solution of linseed varnish in
benzine. This solution may be obtained at any time at any
degree of concentration without the use of heat. Although
it has the advantage that it hardens more rapidly than a
simple solution of linseed oil it has also one disadvantage, for
it gives a somewhat darker colour to light-coloured limestones.
No more of the mixture of varnish and benzine should be
prepared than is required for the impregnation, for this solution,
on standing, throws down a gelatinous precipitate which
is not re-dissolved even by heating. As this alteration is
accelerated by the action of light, the mixture should always
be kept in a dark place.
</p>

<p>
Collodion and zapon<a href="#FN_96" class='fnanchor'>[96]</a>, on account
of the expense, should
only be used for small objects. After impregnation the objects
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72' href='#Page_72'>
[72]</a></span>
should be covered with glass jars, cardboard boxes, etc., to
prevent the precipitation of moisture upon them, as the result
of the rapid evaporation of such volatile substances as benzine
and ether upon exposure to the open air.
</p>

<p>
Rice water, tapioca water, or size (the latter of no greater
strength than 2%) are only applicable to specimens which are
kept in dry rooms, for in damp rooms they readily become
sticky, and are liable to be attacked by moulds. Waterglass
solution, probably because it is generally applied in too concentrated
a form, instead of penetrating the object has a
tendency to form a pellicle, which readily strips off. Even
dilute solutions, however, are said to be unsuitable, from the
liability to the efflorescence of alkali salts.
</p>

<p>
In the case of marble objects and antique statues of porous
limestone, showing colours which are still bright on excavation,
but which would soon fade, Rhousopulos<a name='FA_97' id='FA_97'
href='#FN_97' class='fnanchor'>[97]</a> recommends impregnation
with a very dilute solution (1 in 1000) of waterglass to
preserve the colour. The solution should be as neutral as
possible: in any case not alkaline. This is several times
sprayed upon the object, which is allowed to completely dry
between each spraying.
</p>

<p>
A material which is suitable for large objects to which the
solution can only be applied upon the surface is Kessler&rsquo;s
fluate<a name='FA_98' id='FA_98' href='#FN_98' class='fnanchor'>[98]</a>,
which is soluble in water, and which hardens the limestone
without completely closing the pores. It offers the
additional advantage that it is applicable to thick limestone
blocks, the dryness of which is not certain. The solutions
numbered 1-9 must only be used when the limestone is dry
throughout its mass. The fluate to be used in any particular
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73' href='#Page_73'>
[73]</a></span>
instance must be decided from the nature of the case. Those
most generally applicable are magnesium and zinc fluates and
the so-called &ldquo;double fluate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The stones from the Meten Chamber were hardened in the
following manner: The limestone blocks were placed upright
and the surface dusted by the air-current from a Dechend&rsquo;s
spray apparatus<a name='FA_99' id='FA_99' href='#FN_99'
class='fnanchor'>[99]</a> which was then used to spray them
repeatedly with a solution of &ldquo;double fluate&rdquo; of sp. gr. 1&middot;16.
Owing, however, to the injurious effect of the fine spray of the
fluate upon the nose and lungs the stones were turned to a
horizontal position, and a solution of fluate of sp. gr. 1&middot;38 was
applied by means of a large brush until the fluid was no
longer absorbed. For the treatment of limestones on which
there are remains of colours the use of a solution of shellac,
gum-dammar, or collodion is recommended. Fluates should
not be applied until their suitability for the particular purpose
has been tested.
</p>

<p>
All specimens should be kept after impregnation in rooms
which as far as possible are free from dust, for the dust which
falls upon the surface will set in the varnish whilst it is
hardening.
</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Impregnation without Previous Steeping.</span>
If a preliminary
examination has shown that specimens of limestone
will not bear steeping in water, recourse can be had
to impregnation only. The treatment of such specimens
must be thorough, for merely to paint the fluid upon the
surface with a brush almost invariably proves a failure.
Instead of penetrating the stone the impregnating medium
forms a firm coating which is liable to be lifted, and in parts
broken, by the crystallisation of salts, and thus allows the
destructive processes to continue uninterrupted. Aqueous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74' href='#Page_74'>
[74]</a></span>
solutions, e.g. size, cannot of course be applied, and as it is
necessary to make a preliminary trial of a fluate spray, it is
generally found preferable to make use of the varnish-benzine
mixture. In spite of this, salts may still make their appearance
in the form of a crystalline powdery layer on the surface,
which can be wiped off with a wet sponge; any moisture must
however be removed with a soft dry linen cloth.
</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Removal of Incrustations and Dust.</span> Incrustations
of earth, lime, or gypsum should be washed off with water
or removed by mechanical means, such as gentle rubbing
with the finger. The solvent action of acids upon limestone
precludes their use for this purpose. Any dust which adheres
can be removed by rubbing with stale bread-crumb.
</p>


<h3>
(<i>b</i>) <span class='smcap'>Marble and Alabaster.</span>
</h3>

<p>
It is usually only necessary to clean marble with a soft
brush and warm water, with the addition perhaps of some
good neutral soap. In rare cases the presence of sulphates
may perhaps cause some friability. The crystalline structure
of marble renders steeping futile, and accordingly impregnation
is resorted to. The use of Kessler&rsquo;s fluates may be
recommended. Adherent pitch or resin is best removed by a
mixture of alcohol and ether. Alabaster seems to remain
permanently sound and may be cleaned in the same way.
</p>


<h3>
(<i>c</i>) <span class='smcap'>Earthenware.</span>
</h3>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Steeping.</span> The same line of treatment should
be followed
as in the case of limestones. A preliminary examination
should always be made to test the power of resistance in
water, which is always satisfactory if the clay has been
sufficiently baked.
</p>

<p>
In the case of coloured terra-cotta care should be taken to
ascertain whether the colours are likely to suffer during
steeping. There is no danger of injury if the steeping is not
too prolonged; in fact, the removal of the dust during the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75' href='#Page_75'>
[75]</a></span>
procedure often brings out the colours more clearly. If the
Egyptian ostraca (clay fragments with black script) require to
be washed they should be carefully watched in order to
preserve the script, and therefore should be placed in the bath
in such a way that the lettering is visible.
</p>

<p>
These fragments are usually curved and bear the script
upon the convex side, care should therefore be taken that they
are completely immersed, and that no large air-bubbles prevent
the access of the water to any part of the under-surface. The
writing is done with either lamp-black or more rarely some
form of iron ink, and is retained mechanically by the porous
character of the ostraca. In the latter case the characters
may be enhanced by the application of a dilute solution of
tannic acid, which sometimes proves useful also for limestone
pieces.
</p>

<p>
If these fragments are sufficiently few in number to allow
each to be put into a separate glass vessel, the washing out of
the salts is completed so quickly that there need be little
danger of obscuring the script. When large numbers were
to be washed and when the script was already indistinct I
have employed the following method: After examination as
to their fitness for immersion the fragments are placed on a
wooden grating in a tub, in which they remain for a couple
of days, during which the water is renewed once. They are
then taken out and allowed to dry. All those which still
show the script distinctly are separated and their steeping is
completed, but the remainder, having been completely dried,
perhaps on the top of a warm stove, are brushed over once or
twice with a dilute (1:6) mixture of varnish and benzine in
such a way that the surface is only moistened, and when dry
shows no gloss. The pieces thus superficially varnished are
kept in a dry place for about two months, until the varnish is
hardened; the process of washing out the salt is then
begun again. The thin coat of varnish fixes the script without
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76' href='#Page_76'>
[76]</a></span>
interfering with the steeping. The varnish solution must
be dilute, for a thick coating will partially peel off from the
object in the course of the steeping, or will remain in the
pores in the form of opaque particles, and thus render the
script illegible.
</p>

<p>
The same difficulty which arose in the treatment of the
Meten limestones was frequently met with in the treatment
of these ostraca. Those which were of a dark brown colour
especially, and to a less degree also the red and the yellow,
were covered with a slimy growth of algae. As the script is
easily destroyed no attempt should be made to remove these
algae from the side which bears the script even with the
softest brush, although they should from time to time
during steeping be brushed from the underside. The inconvenience
caused by algae is, however, less marked in the
treatment of earthenware, the light and porous character of
which renders prolonged steeping needless, nor is there the
same necessity to continue the steeping for the purpose of
chlorine estimation. The following results were obtained in
the treatment of 13 fragments, the average thickness of which
was 1 cm. [<span class='nom'>3</span>&frasl;<span class='dem'>8</span>th
inch], with an average superficial area of
<span class='nom'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='dem'>10</span> sq. metre
[4 inches]. The tub in which they were steeped
contained 85 litres [18<span class='nom'>1</span>&frasl;<span
class='dem'>2</span> gallons] of water.
</p>

<p>
100 cubic centimetres of the tap-water used were found
to require 0&middot;5 c.c. of the silver solution, and on each occasion
this quantity of the water was tested.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77' href='#Page_77'>
[77]</a></span>
The water was changed at first daily, then every two days,
and so on: the steeping could therefore be regarded as complete
at the end of a fortnight.
</p>

<p>
A small figure of earthenware, which weighed only 28&middot;9
grammes, was steeped in 1<span class='nom'>1</span>&frasl;<span
class='dem'>2</span> litres of distilled water, and
gave the following result for every 100 c.c. used:
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
  <p>
  Water changed after 2 days required 3&middot;6 c.c. silver solution.<br />
  Water changed after 3 days required 0&middot;4 c.c. silver solution.<br />
  Water changed after 4 days required 0&middot;0 c.c. silver solution.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
The steeping was, therefore, in reality complete after
five days, and, as the steeping water was thoroughly mixed
before the withdrawal of the 100 c.c., the total quantity
of sodium chloride contained in the figure can be calculated
as follows:
</p>

<p>
For the 15th part (viz. 100 c.c.) of the water 3&middot;6 + 0&middot;4,
i.e. 4&middot;0 c.c., of decinormal silver solution were used, which is
equivalent to 15 &times; 4&middot;0, i.e. 60 c.c., of silver solution for
the
whole quantity. Now 1 c.c. of this decinormal solution corresponds
to 0&middot;00584 gramme of sodium chloride; the water
therefore contained 60 &times; 0&middot;00584 gr., or 0&middot;35 gr.
sodium
chloride. Thus the figure contained altogether 1<span
class='nom'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='dem'>5</span>% of sodium
chloride.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the chlorine compounds, there was also a
considerable quantity of sulphates, the presence and disappearance
of which were tested by adding to a few cubic
centimetres of the water a dilute solution of barium nitrate
or of barium chloride<a name='FA_100' id='FA_100' href='#FN_100'
class='fnanchor'>[100]</a>. The soluble barium salts give with
sulphates a white precipitate or cloudiness of insoluble
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78' href='#Page_78'>
[78]</a></span>
barium sulphate. If therefore on the addition of a solution
of barium nitrate no cloudiness appears, even after some time,
it may be concluded that sulphates are no longer present in
the water. When the ostraca have been washed and dried,
it is often possible to make the script more distinct by
varnishing them over with a varnish-benzine mixture (1:6).
</p>

<p>
It is advisable to subject friable objects of earthenware
to the process of impregnation (cp. the impregnation of
unbaked clay, p. <a href="#Page_81">81</a>).
</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>The Removal of Incrustations.</span> Incrustations
of earth
or lime can be easily removed if the earthenware has been
well baked, but trial must first be made with a drop of dilute
hydrochloric acid, whether the earthenware itself is not
attacked by the acid. The specimen is then placed upon a
glass ring or suspended in water containing 2% of hydrochloric
acid<a name='FA_101' id='FA_101' href='#FN_101' class='fnanchor'>
[101]</a>. This mixture, which must be renewed every
24 hours, will remove incrustations which it would be
difficult to remove by mechanical means, while crystals of
gypsum of considerable size, which are often found on clay
tablets of Assyrian origin, are easily dissolved in from two to
four days.
</p>

<p>
Figures <a href="#Fig_16">16</a> to <a href="#Fig_21">21</a> represent
two Assyrian tablets which
have been cleaned by myself in this manner. It will be seen
that the cuneiform characters, which before treatment were
almost invisible, are now distinctly legible.

<p>
After this treatment with acidulated water the acid must
itself be removed by careful washing in pure water. Here
too a solution of silver nitrate will serve as a test, for, so long
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79' href='#Page_79'>
[79]</a></span>
as any chlorine, and therefore any hydrochloric acid, is
present in the water, a white precipitate or cloudiness is
produced.
</p>

<p>
The method of titration with yellow potassium chromate
is not applicable here, for the free acid prevents the appearance
of the red precipitate. The steeping must therefore be
continued in distilled water until the addition of silver nitrate
no longer produces any cloudiness.
</p>

<p>
Baked earthenware which shows colouring, or which has
incised lines filled with substances containing lime, must not
be steeped in acidulated water, nor will ostraca bearing
inscriptions in iron ink stand this treatment; these are, however,
fortunately rare: in fact amongst several thousand
fragments few have shown incrustations of lime or gypsum.
Should any such be found a cautious attempt should be
made to remove the incrustations by some mechanical means.

[81]</a></span>
least sign of running, or if an efflorescence makes its appearance,
the vase is immediately removed and allowed to
dry. It is then dipped into distilled water and allowed to
dry a second time. Impregnation is not necessary.

&ldquo;If the treatment is otherwise successful, but an

are thus affected are lightly touched with the finger

</p>
</div>

<p>
This process evidently requires the greatest care and constant
attention.
</p>


<h3>
(<i>d</i>) <span class='smcap'>Slightly Baked Or Unbaked Clay.</span>
</h3>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Impregnation.</span> If upon examination it is found
that a
drop of water softens the clay, the same line of treatment
must be followed as in the case of limestones which exhibit
a similar condition (see p. <a href="#Page_73">73</a>), i.e. they must be
subjected to
the process of impregnation<a name='FA_104' id='FA_104' href='#FN_104'
class='fnanchor'>[104]</a>. As the colour of the clay
objects is yellow-brown or red-brown, the varnish benzine
mixture will be the most suitable application for the purpose.
A considerable number of sun-dried Assyrian clay tablets
treated in this manner have given good results, and have
undergone no change during the last five years, in fact they
may now even be laid in water without crumbling.
</p>

<p>
In the case of slightly baked or unbaked Babylonian clay
tablets the method formerly employed was merely to remove
deposits of lime, clay, gypsum, etc., by lifting or scraping
them away with pointed or wedge-shaped tools, for the soft
clay would not stand treatment with water, still less with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84'
href='#Page_84'>[84]</a></span>
2% hydrochloric acid. The difficulty in avoiding damage to
the clay surface, when removing the deposit, makes this
method both tedious and risky. Warming to 200-300&deg;C. in
a drying oven, or in an iron box embedded in sand, seldom
aids the removal of incrustations; moreover, this treatment
has no hardening effect upon the clay, and thus does not
facilitate the removal of the injurious salts by soaking. A
further expedient therefore remains, that of heating the clay
to higher temperature, whereby it is fully baked and rendered
capable of resisting subsequent treatment with water or 2%
hydrochloric acid. At the Royal Museum this firing is done
in muffle furnaces<a name='FA_105' id='FA_105' href='#FN_105'
class='fnanchor'>[105]</a>, the smaller of which has a capacity of
about one cubic foot, and is heated by six and twelve Bunsen
burners. The temperature is regulated in the same way as in
porcelain manufacture by the use of Seger&rsquo;s cones<a href="#FN_105"
class='fnanchor'>[105]</a>, which are
placed in the muffle, where they can be seen through the
observation aperture. To avoid cracking the heating must
be gradual, the gas-supply being very gradually increased.
The firing must at first be adjusted to cone 022 [590&deg;C.;
Watkin, No. 1, 1094&deg;F.]; the gas is then turned off and the
furnace allowed to cool as slowly as possible. To effect this
the damper is closed and all openings into the muffle are made
up with fire clay. The clay tablet is removed when quite cold
(usually in 18-24 hours), and, as a rule, much of the incrustation
can then be removed by means of a soft brush. Should
the removal prove difficult, and a preliminary trial have shown
that it will bear the treatment, the removal of the deposits
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85' href='#Page_85'>
[85]</a></span>
will be assisted by soaking for two or three days in water.
Should the tablet prove capable of bearing treatment with
2% hydrochloric acid it may remain in the acid for 12 to
18 hours. If necessary the acid may be renewed once; it
must then be thoroughly removed by steeping in ordinary
water and finally in distilled water, until the wash-water is
free from chlorides. After steeping, the tablets will be found
somewhat softened and occasionally coated with a slimy
growth of algae, care must therefore be used in changing or
taking them from the water. The best way to handle them
is to place the fingers of the two hands under the tablet.

<p>
After thoroughly drying the tablets first in the air, then in
the drying oven at a temperature of 212&deg;F., supported on
glass rings, it is well to impregnate them. This can be best
carried out by placing them, while still warm, into melted
paraffin wax, and raising the temperature to about 250&deg;F.
[120&deg;C.]. The wax is allowed to cool to about 160&deg;F. [70&deg;C.],
when the tablet is removed upon a broad band of gauze, any
excess of wax is drained off, and the object is wiped with a
soft cloth. The benzine-varnish mixture or zapon may also
be used for impregnation. If heating in the muffle to Seger
cone 022 is insufficient to allow of the removal of the incrustations,
or if the condition of the clay does not warrant
soaking in water or acid, the object must be again placed in
the muffle and fired to Seger cone 010 [950&deg;C.; Watkin,
No. 13, 1742&deg;F.], and, if softening occurs upon the application
of water or acid after exposure to this temperature,
recourse must be had to a third heating to Seger cone 05
[1050&deg;C.; Watkin, No. 18, 1922&deg;F.]. Higher temperatures
than this are not advisable, for the lime, sodium chloride,
and other salts found in some Babylonian tablets may partially
fuse. During firing therefore the appearance of the object
must be carefully watched, and the temperature lowered at
once by reducing the gas-supply, if signs of fusion are noticed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86' href='#Page_86'>

</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Additional Methods of Impregnation</span>. If clay
objects
have a smooth surface, it is, according to the &ldquo;Merkbuch<a name='FA_106'
id='FA_106' href='#FN_106' class='fnanchor'>[106]</a>,&rdquo;
advisable to impregnate them with Belmontyl oil<a name='FA_107'
id='FA_107' href='#FN_107' class='fnanchor'>[107]</a>, for varnish
in the course of drying gives a lacquered appearance to the
surface. According to the same authority the surface of
glazed vessels can be restored by impregnating them several
times with a mixture of poppy seed oil and benzine [20 grammes
clarified poppy seed oil in 270 gr. benzine, i.e. 1 in 13<span
class='nom'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='dem'>2</span>], and
by subsequently brushing them first with soft, then with
harder brushes. There are, however, many other substances
used in different collections for impregnation, a few of which
are subjoined.
</p>

<p>
In the Museum at Vienna friable clay objects are laid for
two or three minutes in a dilute solution of warm size, and
when dry are brushed over with a solution of shellac; size
alone, or a solution of shellac alone, is frequently used for
impregnation, or to give a coating. In the Museum at
Wiesbaden thin specimens are impregnated with a solution of
white of egg, brittle objects with dilute fish glue, while for
hard objects a solution of shellac or melted shellac is used.
</p>


<h3>
(<i>e</i>) <span class='smcap'>Fayence</span>.
</h3>

<p>
I have been able to wash out the sulphates from several
Egyptian fayence figures in spite of the glaze, the fissures in
which allowed the water to penetrate into the interior. The
process of steeping, which was necessarily somewhat prolonged,
was tested from time to time by the barium nitrate
test (vide p. <a href="#Page_77">77</a>).
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87' href='#Page_87'>

</p>


<h3>
(<i>f</i>) <span class='smcap'>Objects of Stucco and Nile-mud.</span>
</h3>

<p>
These are rare, and in almost all cases contain salts. As,
however, they will not bear steeping, they must be preserved
by means of impregnation only. The varnish-benzine mixture
should be used for this purpose.
</p>


<h3>
(<i>g</i>) <span class='smcap'>Sandstone and Granite.</span>
</h3>

<p>
These scarcely need any special preservative process, but
Kessler&rsquo;s fluates are useful for the impregnation of weathered
sandstones which are exposed to the open air (see p. <a href="#Page_72">
72</a>).
</p>

<p>
They can be cleaned by washing with warm water, while
calcareous incrustations may be removed by hydrochloric acid.
A thick coating of oil paint was successfully removed from
an Egyptian statue of sandstone by placing it in an alcoholic
solution of soda. Oil colours and similar substances may often
be removed with ease and completeness from stone, plaster,
wood, etc., by placing the objects in air-tight vessels together
with a vessel containing alcohol. The alcohol vaporises, even
at the ordinary room-temperature, and causes a softening of
the paint. The time required for the treatment depends upon
its age and hardness.

<span class='smcap'>Cement for Earthenware.</span> <span class='smcap'>
Restorations.</span>
</h2>

<p>
To fix together pieces of broken pottery good Cologne glue
is useful, but it has the disadvantage that it can only be used
when warm. For this reason it is better to use liquid fish-glue
[Syndeticon], which may, if necessary, be thinned with a
little vinegar. Fire-clay dust in waterglass is used in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88' href='#Page_88'>
[88]</a></span>
Museum at Breslau. A thick ropy solution of shellac<a name='FA_108'
id='FA_108' href='#FN_108' class='fnanchor'>[108]</a> may
also be mentioned, for the use of which the opposing surfaces
must be first moistened with alcohol.
</p>

<p>
Gum arabic and dextrin should not be used, for objects
thus cemented readily fall to pieces unless kept in perfectly
dry rooms. This, however, may also be said of earthenware
which contains salts, if cemented with glue or fish-glue.
Previous steeping would obviate this difficulty.
</p>

<p>
Chalk, plaster of Paris, brick-dust, or fire-clay dust are
often added to the fish-glue, dextrin, etc. Without giving
additional strength to the cement, these substances may be of
use in filling up small gaps between the fragments to be
cemented.
</p>

<p>
For filling up larger gaps the &ldquo;Merkbuch<a name='FA_109' id='FA_109'
href='#FN_109' class='fnanchor'>[109]</a>&rdquo; recommends
stone cement, for the preparation of which it gives the
following prescription:
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
&ldquo;Mix 500 grammes of Cologne glue with three sheets
of strong white blotting-paper, or four sheets of white
tissue paper, shredded as small as possible, and boil until
it becomes thick, stirring the whole into a perfectly
smooth pulp. Let it boil thoroughly, and while stirring
continually, and working with a stout wooden rod,
add 2<span class='nom'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='dem'>2</span>
kilogrammes of very finely sifted dry purified
whiting. After working this mixture thoroughly, add
80 grammes of linseed oil, which must be also thoroughly
worked in. To preserve the glue add 50 grammes of
Venetian turpentine. This stone cement will take any
shade of colour if mixed with lamp-black or coloured
earths.&rdquo;

The various methods for the preservation of iron objects
which have been or are still in use may be divided into two
groups. To the one group belong those methods in which the
objects are preserved with their coating of rust, or with the rust
that has penetrated them; to the other group belong those in
which the removal of rust precedes preservation. The former
methods must be applied when the iron has been completely
converted into rust or when the rust has only left a small
metallic core. These methods may of course be used also for
all iron antiquities.
</p>

<p>
The methods of the second group can be applied to those
objects only which still retain a strong metallic core, in which
case the objects regain the more or less grey or white surface
of fresh unoxidized iron. These methods are at present little
known, and therefore but little used, for owners and the
general public are still accustomed to see in the covering of rust
the evidence of antiquity with which they are loth to part.
</p>

<p>
In addition to these methods, there are others which are
of an intermediate kind, either special or a combination of
methods from both these groups.
</p>


<p class="center">
<b>(1)</b> <span class='subh'>Methods of preserving Objects of Iron
without removal of the Rust.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Impregnation.</span> The earliest processes, which are
to some
extent still in use in some collections, are simple impregnation
methods, in which the object is either painted once or more
with the impregnating medium by means of a brush, or is
placed directly in the medium itself. In either case the
penetrating power of the solution used is directly proportional
to its fluidity.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90' href='#Page_90'>

The following media may be used for the purpose:
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
(1) Warm size.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
(8) Linseed oil.
</p>

<p>
(9) Linseed varnish.
</p>

<p>
(10) Linseed varnish mixed with an equal quantity of
petroleum.
</p>

</p>

<p>
(14)  Vaseline.
</p>

<p>
(15)  Melted paraffin.
</p>

<p>
(16)  Oleate of lead: 100 grammes of olive oil, 100 gr. of
lead oxide, and 100 gr. of water are boiled until all
the water has evaporated and the mass has become
grey. The mass is extracted by shaking it with
alcohol, and the residue is dissolved in absolute
ether, in the proportion of 100 gr. of ether to 5 gr.
of the substance. Before use it should be diluted
with a little ether<a name='FA_112' id='FA_112' href='#FN_112'
class='fnanchor'>[112]</a>.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91' href='#Page_91'>
[91]</a></span>
(17) Speerschneider&rsquo;s mixture. This consists of 8 parts of
rape oil, 1 part of bees&rsquo;-wax, 1 part of pine resin,
and 2 parts of benzene<a name='FA_113' id='FA_113' href='#FN_113'
class='fnanchor'>[113]</a>.
</p>

<p>
(18) Collodion, or the mixture used in the Museum at
Donaueschingen, which consists of 30 grammes of
collodion, 2 gr. of camphor, and 1 gr. of oxalic
ether.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In addition to these materials, there are other mixtures of
resin, varnishes, and bees&rsquo;-wax, with their appropriate solvents,
but they do not possess any special advantages as impregnating
solutions.
</p>

<p>
After treatment with size or isinglass, iron objects may
be given when dry a coating of linseed oil, linseed varnish,
solution of shellac, etc.
</p>

<p>
The materials numbered 7 to 10 in the above list should
be applied warm to enable the viscid fluids to penetrate the
rust, for the more readily the solution enters the object the
better is the result obtained. Apart from the fact that they
are easily ignited at a high temperature, they must not be
heated beyond 230&deg;F. [110&deg;C.], otherwise objects which consist
largely of rust will fall to pieces<a name='FA_114' id='FA_114'
href='#FN_114' class='fnanchor'>[114]</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the process of impregnation a twofold result is aimed
at, viz. to prevent the rust from crumbling, and to exclude
air from the specimen. The application of heated linseed oil
or linseed varnish is founded upon the supposition that these
substances enter into a chemical combination with ferric
oxide to form a stable compound; this is, however, disputed
by some modern authorities<a name='FA_115' id='FA_115' href='#FN_115'
class='fnanchor'>[115]</a>. Neutral substances offer a safer
method for the exclusion of air, and of these melted paraffin
is undoubtedly the best. The paraffin must be quite pure and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92' href='#Page_92'>
[92]</a></span>
free from stearine, as can be ascertained from the melting
point; thus pure paraffin melts at 130&deg;-150&deg;F. [55&deg;-65&deg;C.],
stearine at 160&deg;F. [70&deg;C.]. Paraffin with a melting-point
higher than 65&deg;C. should be looked upon with suspicion.
</p>

<p>
In many collections the objects are heated before impregnation
with media which are insoluble in water, or they are
exposed to the air for six to twelve months after excavation.
This latter proceeding is, however, certainly inadvisable if the
iron contains chlorine, and if this is the case not one of these
methods produces satisfactory results.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, as almost all the iron antiquities which
do not contain chlorine compounds may be treated by the
methods of the second group, simple and direct impregnation
is passing more and more out of use. Before impregnation
all soluble substances, especially chlorine compounds, must be
removed by steeping.
</p>


<p class="center">
<b>(2)</b> <span class='subh'>Preservation by Steeping and Subsequent
Impregnation.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Krause&rsquo;s Method.</span> The water used for steeping
should
be preferably lukewarm, and should be changed every twenty-four
hours. It is even better, at least for the first time, to
lay the object in water and then raise it to boiling-point, a
measure which will allow the more ready penetration of the
water. As in the case of limestones, earthenware, etc. (p.
<a href="#Page_59">59</a>),
care must be taken to place the objects as near to the
surface of the water as is possible. Small objects may be
put in glass jars, large ones in wooden troughs, tin vessels, or
wooden boxes lined with zinc or lead. Any little excrescences
on the iron, which are frequently filled with ferrous chloride,
should be punctured to give the water unimpeded and more
speedy access. Crumbling objects should be held together by
tightly wrapping them in muslin. Curators must decide for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93' href='#Page_93'>
[93]</a></span>
themselves how far means such as files, chisels, or small
hammers may be used to remove the rust or earthy material
conglomerated by rust.
</p>

<p>
Although much recommended, the method of adding soda
or lime water to remove the chlorine as soluble sodium
chloride or calcium chloride is, in our opinion, inadvisable.
Both these substances precipitate the iron from the ferrous
chloride or ferric chloride (which are soluble in water) as
insoluble hydroxide of iron, which more or less closes the
interstices, and thus impedes the access of water to the
interior.
</p>

<p>
The process of steeping can here again be controlled by
the use of the silver solution (p. <a href="#Page_62">62</a>), for if
there no longer
appears any or only very little cloudiness the steeping may be
considered complete. The length of time required for steeping
depends upon the thickness of the rust and the porosity or
existence of cracks in it, and if the objects are of considerable
size, it may extend over several weeks.
</p>

<p>
After steeping the object should either be dried in the
open air, and later on a warm stove, or be placed for a
few days in alcohol to remove the water, after which the
rapid evaporation of the alcohol will quickly dry it. The
steeping of iron objects in warm alcohol has been recommended<a
name='FA_116' id='FA_116' href='#FN_116' class='fnanchor'>[116]</a>,
but if their size is considerable the method is an
expensive one. This method has the advantage that the
alcohol penetrates the rust sooner than does water, and also
prevents oxidation, which may be actually produced by the
water. It may perhaps be advisable to dilute the alcohol, the
usual strength of which is 95% to 96%, with about an equal
volume of water, for some salts are not readily soluble in pure
alcohol. When dry the object is warmed for a few hours in
a mixture of equal parts of good linseed varnish and petroleum.
The petroleum serves to dilute the varnish, which can
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94' href='#Page_94'>
[94]</a></span>
thus more quickly permeate the entire mass of iron and rust.
On account of the inflammable nature of the mixture the
warming should be done over a water-bath. For small objects
a cylinder made of ordinary tin-plate, measuring from 6 to 10
inches [15 to 25 cm.] in diameter and 6 in. [15 cm.] in height,
may be used. To increase stability the lower half should be
of a smaller diameter, and fitted into an iron tripod. The
same end is attained by soldering a ring round the middle of
the cylinder, which will rest on the ring of the tripod. The
cover consists of a number of copper rings gradually diminishing
in diameter, which fit closely into one another, thus
enabling porcelain vessels of various sizes to be used. For
larger objects, such as swords, two long rectangular troughs
(Fig. <a href="#Fig_24">24</a>) of stronger plate should be used. The
following
sizes will probably be found useful: one about 40 inches
[100 cm.] long by 4 inches [10 cm.] broad, and 4 inches
[10 cm.] deep, and the other slightly larger. Handles should
be fixed at the upper edges. Three iron bars 1 inch
[2<span class='nom'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='dem'>2</span> cm.]
thick and 4 inches [10 cm.] in length are laid across the
bottom of the larger trough, on which the smaller is placed.
The space between the two vessels is filled with water to a
depth of 2 inches [6 cm.]. The trough is warmed on a stove,
or better, where gas can be had, by means of a number of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95' href='#Page_95'>
[95]</a></span>
Bunsen burners fitted with rose or ring burners, over which
the trough may be supported upon tripods. While heating
care must be taken that the water does not boil over, which
can be easily avoided by regulating the gas supply. As the
water evaporates further quantities should be added as
required. After simmering for about two hours, the objects
should be removed and allowed to drain; they should then be
placed on a tripod, or on glass rings, on the warm stove in
cold weather, to accelerate the evaporation of the petroleum
and the setting of the varnish. In summer drying chambers
may be used; these are sold by dealers in physical and
chemical apparatus, or can be made at little cost by a tinsmith.

</div>

<p>
If the objects have been steeped in pure alcohol, or at
least towards the end of the treatment in three changes of
alcohol, so that all the water is replaced by alcohol, they may
be dipped directly without drying in the varnish mixture, for
the alcohol evaporates in the varnish bath which is at a
temperature of 194&deg;-203&deg;F. [90&deg;-95&deg;C.]. As the varnish
hardens, the iron thus treated acquires a glazed surface; other
means of impregnation may therefore appear preferable, e.g.
a solution of gum-dammar or melted paraffin. For impregnation
with the dammar solution the object must first be dried,
and the air-pump used in the way described on p. <a href="#Page_68">
68</a>. On
account of the inflammable nature of the benzine heat must
not be applied, nor indeed is it necessary.
</p>

<p>
When impregnating with pure paraffin<a name='FA_117' id='FA_117'
href='#FN_117' class='fnanchor'>[117]</a>, specimens may
be lightly wiped with a cloth, but need not be dried. The
paraffin may be heated to 212&deg;-248&deg;F. [100&deg;-120&deg;C.]
without danger, so long as it is kept from direct contact with
the flame. A thermometer should be used, and, as soon as
the paraffin has melted at a temperature of about 60&deg;C., the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96' href='#Page_96'>
[96]</a></span>
object should be placed in it by means of tongs. When
the temperature has risen above 212&deg;F. [100&deg;C.] the water
is converted into steam, and causes a brisk ebullition of the
melted paraffin. The quantity of paraffin used should, therefore,
be such that its level remains at the least 2 inches
[5 cm.] below the upper edge of the vessel.
</p>

<p>
When the bubbles have ceased to rise, thus showing that
all the water is expelled, the paraffin should be allowed to cool
to a temperature of 180&deg;-190&deg;F. [80&deg;-90&deg;C.]. The iron
should be taken out with tongs, and the liquid allowed to run
off. It should then be wrapped, while still at 80&deg;C., in soft
blotting-paper or in a piece of old linen to absorb the superfluous
paraffin. If the surface of the object is very uneven,
or if there are deep cracks or holes in which the paraffin can
collect, it will, when cold, form a white mass, and should
therefore, while still warm and fluid, be soaked up with filter
paper, or distributed evenly by means of suitable brushes.
The superfluous paraffin may also be absorbed by putting the
object in dry sawdust; any sawdust which remains attached
can be removed when cold with benzine, or it may be scraped
from the spots where it has collected with a knife or spatula.
Any spots where the iron may have become exposed may
be covered with a thin coat of paraffin dissolved in benzine.
</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Ekhoff&rsquo;s Method</span><a name='FA_118' id='FA_118'
href='#FN_118' class='fnanchor'>[118]</a>. The objects are laid for two
or three
months in water which is changed every two or three days, a
small quantity of quicklime being added<a name='FA_119' id='FA_119'
href='#FN_119' class='fnanchor'>[119]</a>. After this steeping,
and after some of the rust has been removed mechanically,
the object is lightly dried and put into heavy petroleum of
sp. gr. 0&middot;85 to 0&middot;95, which is then heated up to 220&deg;F.
[105&deg;C.].
A thermometer should be used to ensure this temperature.
This temperature being higher than the boiling-point of water,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97' href='#Page_97'>
[97]</a></span>
the water contained in the object evaporates and causes the
petroleum to bubble, as in the method previously described.
When all the water has been replaced by the petroleum
the bubbling ceases. After the fluid has somewhat cooled
down, the iron is taken out and is allowed to remain for about
an hour in sawdust, which absorbs the superfluous oil. Finally,
while gently warming the object over a warm, but not too
hot, stove, it is coated over with a mixture of 1 part of bees&rsquo;-wax
and 2 parts of turpentine, or better with paraffin dissolved
in benzine. Heavy petroleum, which we have found
by experience to be a suitable material, is preferable to
varnish in so far as the iron is impregnated by a neutral
substance which is practically liquid paraffin, but has the
disadvantage of being highly inflammable and of being
difficult to obtain at so high a specific gravity.
</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Straberger&rsquo;s Method.</span> This method, for the
description
of which I am indebted to Herr Straberger, has proved
effective in the preservation of a number of iron antiquities in
the Museum at Linz on the Danube. Even iron objects,
which had been in bad condition and had undoubtedly contained
chlorine, have after treatment by this method shown
no signs of change, while the dull black surface has an agreeable
appearance.
</p>

<p>
Straberger places the newly-excavated objects immediately
into linseed oil to prevent the access of air. After remaining
in the oil for some time they are taken out, wrapped in cloths
saturated with linseed oil, and removed packed in sawdust.
Upon arrival they are unwrapped and put into water, to which
a small quantity of soda is added to remove the oil more
easily. The water is frequently changed, and the objects are
meanwhile cleaned mechanically with emery paper and hard
brushes. Any blisters are removed by the aid of a small
hammer and chisel. After steeping they are dried and smoked
over a candle flame which is allowed to play over the whole
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98' href='#Page_98'>
[98]</a></span>
surface. The soot is then rubbed off with a cloth or soft
brush. Objects with a smooth surface may be rubbed with
india-rubber. The preservative action of this proceeding
depends upon the fact that during the smoking, in addition to
the soot, oily products of combustion are deposited from the
candle flame, which prevent the access of air and moisture to
the iron.
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
&ldquo;Objects which are much decayed or cracked should,
when cleaned and thoroughly dry, be again placed into
linseed oil which has been slightly warmed and should
remain therein for a few days before being smoked. Upon
removal from this second oil bath they should be lightly
wiped and dried over a moderately warm stove or in the
sun. Patience is necessary, and nothing further should
be done until the oil has entirely dried in the fine cracks
and crevices and firmly binds the mass. The oil crust on
the surface is then loosened by soaking in a strong soda
solution and wiped off, after which the object is dried,
smoked over the candle flame, and the soot wiped or
brushed off with a soft brush. The smoking and wiping
may be repeated if necessary.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
Herr Straberger states that his treatment has been
successful when impregnation with isinglass and coating
with shellac has failed.
</p>

<p>
The methods of Hartwich and Jacobi hold an intermediate
place between the above methods and those which will be
subsequently explained. With the former they have this in
common that they do not call for the entire removal of the
rust and that they require the use of linseed oil; on the other
hand their application presupposes the existence of a strong
metallic core, otherwise when the rust is removed they will
show merely a skeleton of the original object. The existence
of a sufficiently substantial metallic core can be easily ascertained
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99' href='#Page_99'>
[99]</a></span>
from the weight, for an object, which consists solely or
in great part of the oxide of a metal, is much lighter than one
of the same size which is largely metal. The ring also affords
a test, for an iron object, of which the greatest part is metallic
iron, gives a clearer note when struck than one which is
chiefly rust. A still more certain test is the use of a file or a
drill (comp. page <a href="#Page_107">107</a>).
</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Hartwich&rsquo;s Method</span><a name='FA_120' id='FA_120'
href='#FN_120' class='fnanchor'>[120]</a>. This method is intended for
objects of an especially large size, the hard oxide coating of
which does not allow satisfactory steeping. Hartwich heats
the object to redness, allows it to cool slowly, and then
scrapes off the outer layer which has been rendered friable
by this treatment. The subsequent procedure is that of
Krause&rsquo;s method, viz. warming in linseed varnish.
</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Jacobi&rsquo;s Method.</span> The method of preservation of
iron
antiquities used in the Saalburg Museum at Homburg is
described by Jacobi as follows: The object is heated in the
fire of a forge, which causes the chief part of the rust to flake
off, while any rust which still adheres is removed when cold
by water and brushing. The object is again held in the flame
with tongs and heated (smaller objects may be placed on an
iron plate); and during the heating is quickly taken out three
or four times and each time brushed over with linseed oil.
Most of the linseed oil is thus burnt and the deposition of
carbon gives to the iron a black colour, while the oil which
has been partially burnt or hardened by the heat produces
a slight lustre. This process, as carried out at Homburg
by a locksmith, is that which blacksmiths ordinarily use to
blacken iron objects and to protect them from rust. The
preservation has proved permanent, and only in rare cases has
it been found necessary to repeat the process. These good
results are probably due to the fact that the antiquities of iron
preserved in that Museum are for the most part found in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100' href='#Page_100'>
[100]</a></span>
good condition, having very little rust and certainly containing
only a very small amount of chlorine. Iron articles which
contain chlorine but which still have a good metal core, after
washing, drying, and a cautious preliminary application of
heat, are ready for treatment by Jacobi&rsquo;s method.
</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Inlaid Iron Objects</span> require especially
cautious treatment.
Although I have not had any personal experience in
the treatment of objects of this kind, good results have been
obtained in several Museums, especially in that at Mainz.
</p>

<p>
The following quotation from the &ldquo;Merkbuch&rdquo; (p. 75)
describes the method which is applied at Mainz, where it
probably originated:
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
&ldquo;Objects of this kind which are likely to have been
originally inlaid with silver, gold, copper or brass, as
is frequently the case with objects of the Merovingian
period, are not placed in alcohol after the steeping, but
are warmed and dipped three or four times into a hot
dilute solution of isinglass. The heating is necessary,
otherwise the isinglass will set on the surface and will
not penetrate into the interior. When the object has
been dried and the isinglass has set, the layer of rust
which covers the inlaid ornaments is scraped off with a
graving tool, and any spongy hollow parts are filled up
with a paste made of iron rust and isinglass, before the
inlaid work is cleaned. During the scraping the object
is held in the left hand on a little wooden board covered
with plush or thick chamois leather, to which it is fixed
as firmly as is necessary by means of a vice. In scraping
special care must be taken that the graving tool follows
the lines of the designs, for in scraping across the design
it may slip under the flat silver thread and raise it out of
its place. When the ornamentation has been completely
laid bare, it is rubbed with emery cloth and then
polished with a brush and fine emery powder. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101' href='#Page_101'>
[101]</a></span>
piece is then dipped into a solution of gum-dammar, and,
when the surface is dry, emery is again used to remove
the varnish, which gives the silver a slightly yellow
colour. The object is then protected from the influence
of air and moisture by the transparent retouching varnish
of Sohn&eacute;e fr&egrave;res (Paris).&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
A modification of Krefting&rsquo;s method (p. <a href="#Page_108">108</a>) has
proved
eminently successful in the treatment of iron objects inlaid
with silver. Krause<a name='FA_121' id='FA_121' href='#FN_121'
class='fnanchor'>[121]</a> recommends that the article be placed,
with the inlaid surface downwards, for 24 hours in a
mixture of
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
10 grammes of 40% acetic acid,<br />
10 grammes of ammonium chloride,<br />
70 grammes of distilled water,<br />
10 grammes of aluminium powder.
</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">
It is then removed from the bath, carefully brushed and
washed, and, if the inlaid work is not yet cleaned, is replaced
in the bath. This is repeated until the inlaid work is completely
exposed. Spots of ferroso-ferric oxide which are
difficult to remove may be ground away by an emery wheel,
care being taken that the inlaid surface is held against the
lower side of the wheel (which must be rotated in the reverse
direction) so that it is always in sight.
</p>

<p>
All the methods of this group, which have been applied to
many articles in various Museums, exhibit one inherent
defect, for any rust which remains after treatment may cause
the continued oxidation of the iron. The effects of this action
of rust are, I believe, extremely small, and it must at the
same time be admitted that iron antiquities, even if they have
been well steeped and afterwards impregnated, do not always
remain in a permanent and sound state of preservation. If
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102' href='#Page_102'>
[102]</a></span>
in such a case the well-known small watery bubbles should
make their appearance, the steeping has undoubtedly been
insufficient. This evil can be remedied by gradually heating
the object to redness to destroy the impregnating material,
and by a careful repetition of the steeping and impregnation.

<p>
<span class='subh'>Steffensen&rsquo;s Method (Copenhagen).</span> The objects
are
carefully heated over a flame and are then laid in dilute
sulphuric acid. The sulphuric acid dissolves a certain amount
of the iron, and it is found by experience that the chemical
action is strongest at those spots where any rust remains, and
that this is detached by the hydrogen which is produced.
When the cleaning is sufficient, the iron is laid in a dilute
soda solution to neutralise the acid, and is afterwards well
washed with water and dried in an oven. When dry the
iron is brushed over with a solution of bees&rsquo;-wax (or better of
paraffin) in benzine, the evaporation of which leaves a protective
coating of bees&rsquo;-wax or paraffin.

firmly attached incrustation of rust will require a
repetition of the process. By this means not only is the
rust converted into a red powder which is easily rubbed
off, but the object itself is rendered more suitable for the
subsequent treatment. At the same time the heating
process removes any coating of oil, fat, etc., which may
have remained from previous attempts at preservation,
and which would interfere with the further stages of the
process. Smaller or delicate specimens should be treated
in the flame of a spirit-lamp, but special care must be
taken that there is sufficient iron present. Sword blades
and other tools and weapons with sharp edges should be
heated only, for the sudden cooling may cause cracks in
the cutting edges.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
To complete the removal of the incrustation of rust which
has been loosened by the heating process, or by the heating
and sudden cooling, the object should be placed
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
&ldquo;in a well-stirred mixture composed of one part by weight
of sulphuric acid in nine parts of water. Bubbles of
hydrogen will immediately rise and the rust will begin
to separate. In freshly prepared acid objects which
are not very rusty will be freed from rust after four
to six hours, those covered with a deeper layer of
rust in about twelve hours, but several days, or even
weeks, may be necessary. The duration of the process
depends upon the strength of the acid and the character
of the rust, viz. whether it is thick and solid, or thin
and porous, and whether the iron is of a soft, or of a
hard character.
</p>

<p>
When first making use of this method it is advisable
to use dilute acid and to take out the objects several
times in the course of the day and examine them, while
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104' href='#Page_104'>
[104]</a></span>
during the night they should be taken out of the acid
and placed in soft water<a name='FA_123' id='FA_123' href='#FN_123'
class='fnanchor'>[123]</a>.
</p>

<p>
For the acid bath and for rinsing it will be found
convenient to have two pairs of wooden troughs having
the following internal measurements:
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
(1)  An internal length of 10 inches [25 cm.] by
7<span class='nom'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='dem'>2</span> inches
[19 cm.] in breadth and 4<span class='nom'>3</span>&frasl;<span
class='dem'>4</span>
inches [12 cm.]
in depth, which will be useful for the larger number
of objects.
</p>

<p>
(2)  For long narrow objects, e.g. sword-blades,
and long spear-heads, the internal measurements should
be 40 inches [100 cm.] long by 4 inches [10 cm.] broad
and 3 inches [8 cm.] deep.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Small fragile objects are most satisfactorily treated
in glass vessels or glazed earthen pots or vases.
</p>

<p>
The acid must have free access to all parts of the
object; if a sword, for example, lies flat upon the bottom,
the under-surface apparently remains unacted upon by
the acid. This should be remedied by the use of a couple
of small wooden supports.
</p>

<p>
Frequent rubbing with a cloth and forge scale<a name='FA_124' id='FA_124'
href='#FN_124' class='fnanchor'>[124]</a> or
coarse sand greatly helps in removing the rust, but
gentler treatment is required for the smaller and more
fragile objects. The rust is often very firmly attached in
some portions of the object, and in this case those areas
which have been already freed from rust should be coated
over with lard, which is free from salt, to protect them
from further action of the acid, while the pockets of rust
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105' href='#Page_105'>
[105]</a></span>
are alternately treated with acid and graving tools. No
particle of rust should be allowed to remain, for sooner
or later it will begin to spread, whatever precautions
may be taken.
</p>

<p>
The action of the acid becomes less effective if it has
been used for several objects. A little fresh acid should
then be added. The more active the sulphuric acid, the
brighter will be the grey colour of the iron after the rust
has been removed. If old acid has been used the iron
will be of a dirty grey colour, and should then be placed
into fresh acid for a short time until it assumes a clear
light grey colour.
</p>

<p>
The third part of the process begins with the removal
of the iron from the acid bath and has as its object the
removal of every trace of the acid, otherwise the rust will
very quickly return and cover the whole surface. The
object is therefore immediately and repeatedly rinsed in
soft water and carefully dried; the cheapest material for
this purpose is cotton waste, but ordinary linen-cloth
must be used for objects with jagged edges, for the threads
will catch in the notches and hinder the drying. This
should be done without delay, or a change of the colour
from light grey to yellow will betoken a new formation
of rust. Articles showing a very complicated construction,
which are however rare from the Iron Age,
should be packed in perfectly dry hot pinewood sawdust,
while those which are still more difficult to dry, for
example, coats of chain-mail, after thorough rinsing,
should be immediately put into a pan with melted lard,
free from salt, and boiled until the cessation of bubbling
shows that all the water has been driven off by
evaporation.
</p>

<p>
They are then rubbed dry or are laid in hot sawdust,
after which they are brushed over with melted lard and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106' href='#Page_106'>
[106]</a></span>
placed in this condition for at least half an hour in a
moderately hot cupboard until the fat has penetrated
into the finest pores of the iron. That this has really
taken place may be proved by the use of a file.
</p>

<p>
When by this means all trace of sulphuric acid has
been removed the fourth stage of the process is reached,
viz. the removal of the grease from the surface and the
subsequent application of some preparation to prevent
the access of air and moisture. Most of the grease is
removed by placing the objects in a warm place on
blotting-paper. Any grease still remaining on the surface
can be entirely removed with a cloth or paint-brush by
means of benzine. If no restoration or repair is required
nothing more is necessary than to apply the protecting
solution.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
A white varnish has much to recommend it from its
protective power, but as it gives to iron an unsatisfactory
gloss, it is preferable to use a solution of bees&rsquo;-wax in benzine.
</p>

<p>
Having made use of Blell&rsquo;s method in a number of cases
I have a few suggestions and modifications to offer. The
heating should be carried out carefully and gradually, lest
the sudden conversion of the moisture in the rust into steam
should cause small explosions which would scatter pieces of
rust. There is no danger of this if the objects are heated in
an oven; they should not therefore be heated in an open flame.
For smaller objects I use a box six inches [15 centimetres]
square, of strong tin-plate loosely covered with an iron lid,
or with a piece of asbestos sheet; but if the objects are large,
e.g. swords, spearheads, etc., I heat them on a strong piece
of tin-plate bent round to form a channel, and covered with
a long piece of asbestos sheet, the edges of which are bent
over the edges of the channel, to retain the heat as much
as possible.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107' href='#Page_107'>
[107]</a></span>
It is advisable, in my experience, to use the sulphuric
acid well diluted, e.g. in the proportion of 1 to 20, and to
renew it several times if necessary. In mixing concentrated
sulphuric acid with water great caution is required on account
of the evolution of heat. The acid should be poured in a thin
stream into the water, but not vice vers&acirc;, and the mixture
should be constantly stirred with a glass rod. If a glass
vessel is used for the mixing, it must not be too thick lest
the heat should cause it to break, but the larger the proportion
of water to the sulphuric acid, the less considerable
will be the rise of temperature.
</p>

<p>
For boring out rust spots which have eaten deeply into
the iron a dental drill can be used with success, and a great
variety of drills and milling cutters can be obtained. The
rinsing, which Blell carries out by moving the object to and
fro close under the surface in a vessel full of water, may be
sufficient for thin iron objects, such as swords, knives, spear-heads,
and similar objects. Larger specimens should be freed
from the acid by putting them into a still more dilute
solution, and, when necessary, by steeping for a short time
in water. It may also be advisable to put the objects
into dilute soda solution to neutralize the sulphuric acid,
but this does not do away with the necessity for steeping
in water. The brown coating of rust which may possibly
follow the steeping can be removed by the use of steel-wire
brushes, which can now be made of such fine wire that their
softness almost equals that of a moderately soft tooth-brush.
Brass-wire brushes should not be used, on account of the
yellow colour which they give to the iron. I always put the
objects directly after steeping into clean fat heated to 250&deg;F.
[120&deg;C.], for brushing over with fat and warming in a stove
often caused a slight tarnish to cover the surface. I have
also used paraffin wax instead of fat.
</p>

<p>
For the method of restoring iron antiquities and of filling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108' href='#Page_108'>
[108]</a></span>
up large gaps, the reader should refer to
Blell&rsquo;s detailed account; it will here
suffice to quote his statement that a
mixture of iron filings with tin filings
can be used for this purpose. These are
melted and applied by the aid of a blowpipe.
</p>

<p>
The accompanying illustrations represent
iron antiquities which have been
treated by Blell&rsquo;s method: the sword
(Fig. <a href="#Fig_25">25</a>) proved, after reduction, from
its two ridges to be a scramasax; on the
spear-head (Fig. <a href="#Fig_26">26</a>) treatment revealed
a small copper ring at the most constricted
part, while the fibula, which
previously had been a mass of rust, now
shows the spiral which had been totally
disguised.

<span class='subh'>Krefting&rsquo;s Method.</span> The electro-chemical
method of Krefting was originally
published in &ldquo;Aarsberetning fra
Foreningen till Norske Fortidsmindesmaerkers
Bevaring,&rdquo; 1892 (p. 51), but
in &ldquo;Finska Fornminnesf&ouml;reningens Tidskrift<a name='FA_125'
id='FA_125' href='#FN_125' class='fnanchor'>[125]</a>&rdquo;
there is a translation into German
by H. Appelgren, and an additional
series of observations and experiments
by him. His remarks are equally applicable
to Blell&rsquo;s method, and the following
extracts and quotations from this paper
give Krefting&rsquo;s method of procedure and
the circumstances under which it should
be applied.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109' href='#Page_109'>
[109]</a></span>
Small fragile objects such as fibulae, thin clasps and
bracelets or those which are much eaten away by rust, are
not suitable for this mode of treatment, thus:
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
&ldquo;A knife which is much corroded, and which when
taken out of the earth shows a distinctive form (for
example, that of the Early Iron Age), may lose so much
by the application of the electric current that every
distinct sign of its original character is destroyed. The
characteristic edges of a spear-head or of an axe of the
late Iron Age, or the equally characteristic point of an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110' href='#Page_110'>
[110]</a></span>
iron sword, may, if the rust has eaten deeply into them,
be unrecognisable when removed from the electrolytic
bath. A sword, the hilt of which is inlaid with copper
wire or is plated with silver or gold, or the blade inlaid
with inscriptions in gold, silver, or copper, may be
totally destroyed by incautious treatment; for the ornamentation,
if undermined by rust, may be detached with
the rust from the underlying iron.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
On the other hand, objects of sound metallic iron covered
with an incrustation of rust about <span class='nom'>1</span>&frasl;<span
class='dem'>25</span> inch [1 millim&egrave;tre] in
thickness may be easily cleaned in this manner, but if on
using a file the metal does not appear at all, or only at a
depth of <span class='nom'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='dem'>8</span> inch
[3 millim&egrave;tres], great caution must be used.
If there is reason to believe that there is gold or silver inlaid
work undermined by rust, Appelgren recommends that the
object should, as a preliminary, be laid in clean water, which
should be renewed every day. After some time, three weeks
at the most, sufficient rust will have been cleared away by
carefully brushing with a steel brush to lay bare the ornamentation,
at least in part, and it can then be ascertained
whether there is any rust underneath which would, if Krefting&rsquo;s
method were used, cause the ornamentation to be detached.
</p>

<p>
The line of treatment is as follows: The metallic iron
core is laid bare by filing in several places. The specimen
is then wrapped with strips of zinc in such a way that the
zinc is in actual contact with the bare metal (Fig.
<a href="#Fig_28">28</a>). The
whole is then placed into a 5% solution of caustic soda<a name='FA_126'
id='FA_126' href='#FN_126' class='fnanchor'>[126]</a>.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111' href='#Page_111'>
[111]</a></span>
Appelgren uses a solution of 3<span class='nom'>1</span>&frasl;<span
class='dem'>
2</span>-4<span class='nom'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='dem'>2</span> lbs.
[1<span class='nom'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='dem'>2</span>-2
kilogrammes] of caustic soda in
2 gallons [10 litres] of water. The rust
is cleared away by voltaic action; the
iron forms the negative pole, the zinc the
positive of a voltaic cell, in which the
water is resolved into its constituents,
viz. oxygen and hydrogen. At the negative
pole, i.e. the iron, the hydrogen
rises up in small bubbles and acts in
part by mechanically detaching the rust
as in Blell&rsquo;s method, in part also by the
chemical conversion of the rust into
metallic iron, or into a compound which
contains a smaller quantity of oxygen
than does ordinary rust. The oxygen
combines with the zinc to form zinc
oxide, which is dissolved in the soda
solution. The process is usually completed
in 24 hours<a name='FA_127' id='FA_127' href='#FN_127' class='fnanchor'>
[127]</a>. The black powder
which is loosely attached to the iron is
best rubbed off with wet sand and fine
wire brushes. Any hard pieces of black
stable rust (Edelrost), magnetic oxide
of iron, which have not yielded to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112' href='#Page_112'>
[112]</a></span>
electric current should be removed by means of a small chisel.
After rinsing the object thoroughly in water, it should be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">
</a><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115' href='#Page_115'>[115]</a></span>
placed in melted paraffin at 240&deg;F. [115&deg;C.], which will expel
every trace of moisture. On removal the melted paraffin
should be allowed to drain off, and thus leave when cold a
protective covering upon the iron<a name='FA_128' id='FA_128'
href='#FN_128' class='fnanchor'>[128]</a>.
</p>

<p>
The following points should be observed in the application
of the method. Vessels of glass or glazed earthenware should
be used for the reduction, while long swords can be put into tall
glass cylinders or into wooden troughs, the interior of which
must be coated over with paraffin. The soda solution must
be kept in a closed glass bottle<a name='FA_129' id='FA_129'
href='#FN_129' class='fnanchor'>[129]</a>. It should be diluted with
water until the specific gravity, as shown by the hydrometer,
is 1&middot;06; the mixture will then contain about 5 per cent.
of caustic soda. During the reduction process the mixture
frequently assumes a brownish colour as the result of the
presence of organic matter associated with the rust. On
account of the dissolved zinc which it contains it cannot be
used a second time, unless regenerated by boiling with quicklime.
The solution is, however, so cheap that this is scarcely
worth the trouble.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116' href='#Page_116'>
[116]</a></span>
The objects should be handled with metal tongs, and
should not be touched with the hand until they have at least
been dipped or rinsed in water, for
the soda solution has an injurious
effect upon the skin. A basin containing
vinegar, dilute hydrochloric
or sulphuric acid should always
be at hand into which the fingers
should be quickly dipped if they
have been in contact with the caustic
soda. These materials will serve
also for cleaning the vessels used
in the reduction process.
</p>

<p>
The zinc strips should be <span class='nom'>1</span>&frasl;<span
class='dem'>4</span> to
<span class='nom'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='dem'>3</span>
inch [<span class='nom'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='dem'>2</span>
cm. to 1 cm.] in breadth,
and should be cut out of a piece of
sheet zinc of moderate thickness,
but of sufficient pliability.
</p>

<p>
Any firmly fixed rust may be removed
by mechanical means, such
as the graver, drill, etc., as has been
previously mentioned. If in rinsing
a slight layer of oxide appears,
although this is rare, it should be
brushed off with a steel-wire brush.
</p>

<p>
If one portion only of a specimen
requires reduction (the other portion
having, for example, remains of
wood attached, and therefore being
unsuitable for reduction), that portion
only should be wrapped with
the zinc and immersed in the
solution.
</p>

<p>
The results obtained by Krefting's preservation-process are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117' href='#Page_117'>
[117]</a></span>
quite as surprising as those which are
afforded by Blell&rsquo;s method. Figure
<a href="#Fig_29">29</a>, taken from Appelgren&rsquo;s work,
shows the lower portion of a spear-head
before and after treatment, by
which it became apparent that the
whole socket was plated with silver,
with two engraved and gilded animal
figures. Fig. <a href="#Fig_34">34</a> represents a piece
of a sword, on which an inscription
was brought to light by the reduction
process.

<span class='subh'>Hartwich&rsquo;s Reduction Method</span><a name='FA_131'
id='FA_131' href='#FN_131' class='fnanchor'>[131]</a>.
This method is only applicable to
small objects, because it necessitates
the subjection of the objects to red-heat
in a glass tube in a current of
hydrogen. By these means the hydrogen
combines with the oxygen of the
oxides, which are thus reduced to
metallic iron. Owing to the explosive
nature of a mixture of hydrogen and
air, this process should only be carried
out by one who is conversant with
chemical methods, for results which
are equally good can be obtained at
less expense by Krefting&rsquo;s method.
For Hartwich&rsquo;s method a strong core
of metal is essential, for although
objects which are entirely oxidized
may be thus reduced, the result will be
the formation of a more or less loose
iron powder which is frequently in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118' href='#Page_118'>
[118]</a></span>
such a fine state of division that by union with the oxygen
of the air, in consequence of the great amount of surface
presented, it becomes red-hot with the formation of ferric
oxide as a combustion product.
</p>

<p>
It is advisable to apply a combination of Blell&rsquo;s or
Krefting&rsquo;s method with one of the first group (under certain
conditions) to such iron objects as are found, during the
process of preservation, to be penetrated by black stable rust
to such a degree that the complete removal would only leave
a kind of iron skeleton. Fig. <a href="#Fig_35">35</a> represents such
an iron
dagger-sheath<a name='FA_132' id='FA_132' href='#FN_132' class='fnanchor'>
[132]</a>, the dark spots upon it being rust. After
heating and cooling down and a short treatment with acid the
removal of the rust was proceeded with mechanically, but was
not completed. The object was then well steeped, and when
dry was warmed in the varnish-petroleum mixture<a name='FA_133'
id='FA_133' href='#FN_133' class='fnanchor'>[133]</a>.

<p>
Iron objects, the size of which is inconsiderable, such as
arrow heads, small rings, etc., can be very quickly reduced, if
they still have a well-preserved core, by heating them for a
short time in molten potassium cyanide<a name='FA_134' id='FA_134'
href='#FN_134' class='fnanchor'>[134]</a>. The cyanide may
be melted in a porcelain crucible supported by wire gauze
on a tripod over a good-sized Bunsen burner, and the object
introduced by the aid of tongs. The reaction is accompanied
by vigorous effervescence and is soon complete. It is then
taken out and dropped into cold water. By repeatedly boiling
in fresh quantities of water it is thoroughly cleansed, then
treated with paraffin wax, or the water may be expelled by
alcohol. It is then dried, and finally impregnated with zapon.
If the cyanide treatment is insufficient, any remaining rust
may be removed by drills or other suitable tools. Hitherto
this method has only been applied to a small number of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>
[119]</a></span>
objects, but there is no doubt that its use may be largely
extended. Owing to the poisonous nature of the cyanide this
method should be left to those who possess chemical knowledge.
The disadvantage of the process lies in the difficulty
of fusing large quantities of the potassium cyanide<a name='FA_135'
id='FA_135' href='#FN_135' class='fnanchor'>[135]</a>.

A complete treatise on this subject would be beyond the
limits of a handbook, the following observations, therefore,
will be sufficient for our purpose. The rust spots on objects
of this kind are frequently only superficial and can be removed
either mechanically by rubbing with pumice or emery, etc.,
or chemically by a concentrated solution of sodium sulphide<a
name='FA_136' id='FA_136' href='#FN_136' class='fnanchor'>[136]</a>.
To prepare this, sodium sulphide is dissolved in water, or
flowers of sulphur are boiled in a solution of caustic soda. If
the object is too large for immersion, the solution may be
applied with a brush, and if the layer of rust is thick, the
application must be repeated. After treatment the object
must be rinsed in water and dried.
</p>

<p>
Small articles can be freed from rust by immersion in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120' href='#Page_120'>

strong fuming nitric acid<a name='FA_137' id='FA_137' href='#FN_137'

condition in which it is not acted upon even by dilute acids,
and can be safely washed in water. When thoroughly cleaned,
the most suitable protective is some neutral substance such
as paraffin wax, vaseline, or paraffin dissolved in benzine, but
any of the numerous forms of oil or fat may be used.

<p>
Well-preserved bronzes with a stable patina, such as the
highly esteemed glossy stable or &ldquo;edel&rdquo; patina, or that which,
although not glossy, covers the bronze with a rough and
often crystalline coating, should not be interfered with. Such
bronzes as need treatment should be subjected either to simple
cleaning or to some appropriate method of preservation.
</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>The Cleaning of Bronzes.</span> Bronzes, the metallic
substance
of which is more or less intact, while the surface is
hidden under earthy or sandy material cemented together by
copper compounds, may be cleaned either by mechanical or
chemical means. When the materials forming the incrustation
are more firmly cemented together than they are to
the material beneath (which often still
retains a polished surface), a small
hammer may be used, but more adherent
portions require the use of
small chisels, which can be made to
order in different shapes or sizes. I
have used with advantage hammers with striking surfaces like
those shown in Fig. <a href="#Fig_36">36</a>. The two on the right are
rounded so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121' href='#Page_121'>
[121]</a></span>
that they touch the object at one point or on a line only.
The process may be facilitated by the use of Springer&rsquo;s method.
A warm thick solution of glue should be spread upon the incrustation
covering the bronze. As the glue dries and becomes
cool it scales off, carrying with it some portion at least of
the crust, thus leaving the metal clean. That part of the
glue which remains can then be readily detached by gentle
strokes with a hammer. The eyes should be protected when
using the hammer, whether on the incrustation or on the glue.

</div>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Other Methods.</span> Since metallic oxides are
scarcely, if
at all, soluble in water, washing with water, even when a
brush is used, will remove only earth or soil which is loosely
attached. Compounds containing oxygen or oxygen and
chlorine are, however, more or less soluble in ammonia, and,
if they are thin and not too compact, after immersion for
some time can be removed with a brush. Thick compact
layers are loosened with difficulty.
</p>

<p>
Immersion in 2-5% hydrochloric acid acts more effectively,
while sulphuric acid, nitric acid, and concentrated
acetic acid have the same action. The frequent use of these
reagents is, however, strongly to be deprecated, for it is
impossible to remove the acid by simple washing with water
after the incrustation has been removed. The bronze should
be washed and placed in a very dilute soda solution or in
dilute ammonia, after which it should be again well washed
with distilled water. As has been explained in
<a href="#Part_I">Part I.</a>, it is to
chlorine compounds that the destruction of bronzes is chiefly
due, and these are actually produced by the hydrochloric
acid treatment. If the bronzes are not thoroughly washed,
and this is no easy matter, sooner or later efflorescences
will make their appearance, and the process of preservation
must be repeated if the destructive action is to be arrested.
</p>

<p>
Various attempts have been made to remove the incrustation
by raising the bronze to a red heat. This process is not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122' href='#Page_122'>
[122]</a></span>
recommended; for not only does it give to the bronze an
unpleasant appearance, but it detaches any inlaid metal (gold
or silver) or enamel which may be present.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, it may be stated that, although the process
is slow and laborious, the best results are obtained by careful
removal of incrustations by mechanical means.

<span class='subh'>Preservation of Bronze and Copper Objects.</span>
</p>

<p>
<b>(A.)</b> <span class='subh'>Methods of Impregnation.</span> The impregnation
of
bronzes, as of the majority of antiquities, has for some time
been carried out by the use of solutions similar to those
already enumerated for iron. These are applied directly or
after the specimen has been either steeped in water or treated
with dilute acids. This latter treatment, as has been already
stated, is to be avoided, and if used all acid must be washed
out before the object is dried. Steeping in water is of little
use, because compounds containing oxygen or chlorine are
often insoluble in water, which will at most only wash off
loosely attached dirt or earthy material. The impregnation
process may therefore be applied directly, and this should be
done in all cases in which the surface is much corroded, warty
(Figs. <a href="#Fig_7">7</a> and <a href="#Fig_8">8</a>), or cracked
(Figs. <a href="#Fig_37">37</a> and <a href="#Fig_38">38</a>), or in which
there is little or no core of metal. Impregnation is also the
only means of preservation when the formation of oxides has
raised inlaid metals or enamel in such a way that the removal
of the oxides would detach them. The &ldquo;Merkbuch<a name='FA_140' id='FA_140'
href='#FN_140' class='fnanchor'>[140]</a>&rdquo; recommends
poppy seed oil and benzine mixture (p. <a href="#Page_70">70</a>) or the
gum-dammar
solution. To obtain thorough impregnation this
should be carried out by extraction of the air, as has been
already recommended in the case of limestone (p.
<a href="#Page_68">68</a>). The
object must also be perfectly dry, which may be insured
either by exposure to moderate heat or by keeping it for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124'></a>
<a id='Page_123' name='Page_123' href='#Page_123'>[123]</a></span>
some time over anhydrous calcium chloride<a name='FA_141' id='FA_141'
href='#FN_141' class='fnanchor'>[141]</a>. The object is
placed under a glass bell jar, the edges of which are smeared
with vaseline to ensure contact with the glass plate upon
which it rests. The calcium chloride should be placed in an
open glass vessel, beneath the bronze, but care must be taken
that they are not in actual contact.

Immersion of bronzes in paraffin wax at 240&deg;F. [115&deg;-120&deg;C.]
gives results which are as good, if not better, than
those obtained by the use of solutions.
</p>

<p>
Should efflorescences make their appearances upon bronzes
which have been impregnated, their further spread may often
be successfully prevented by smearing fish-glue on the parts
affected. Fish-glue, however, has not proved a satisfactory
material for the complete impregnation or coating of bronzes
which are in the last stages of decay.
</p>

<p>
<b>(B.)</b> <span class='subh'>Preservation by Reduction.</span> It has been
previously
explained (pp. <a href="#Page_28">28</a> <i>et seq.</i>) that the
efflorescences upon bronze
known as creeping or malignant patina which may in time
cause the complete destruction of the metal are due to the
action of sodium chloride. It is found upon all Egyptian
bronzes and upon those from some other localities.
</p>

<p>
The metal, especially the copper, is converted into the
so-called basic chloride. In the reduction processes an attempt
is made to reduce these compounds again to metal, while the
chlorine thus liberated forms chemical compounds, which may
be subsequently washed out with water. There are two
methods which effect this reduction, viz., that of Finkener
(Berlin) and that of Krefting. The principle of both is
electrolytic, and both bring about the complete removal of
the patina and the restoration of a clean metallic surface.
</p>

<p>
To complete this portion of the subject a third method
may be mentioned, viz., reduction by heat in a stream of
hydrogen. This method<a name='FA_142' id='FA_142' href='#FN_142'
class='fnanchor'>[142]</a> is, however, only applicable to small
objects.
</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Finkener&rsquo;s Method.</span> Care must be taken when
examining
the bronze that the metallic-looking mixture of
cuprous oxide with other copper compounds is not mistaken
for metallic copper. When it has been ascertained that the
bronze still has a good metallic core, and that any inlaid
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126' href='#Page_126'>
[126]</a></span>
metals which may be present rest on the metal itself and
not upon a crust of oxide, a platinum wire should be tightly
wound round it. This should be connected by an insulated
copper wire to the zinc or negative pole of the first of
3 or 4 Daniell cells, or, better, of two accumulators arranged
in series. The object should then be immersed in a 2%
aqueous solution of potassium cyanide. In the same solution,
as near as possible to the bronze without actual contact,
should be placed a piece of platinum foil connected first
by an emerging platinum wire, and then by an insulated
copper wire to the positive pole. The potassium cyanide
completes the electric circuit and electrolysis takes place,
whereby the water is split up into its constituents. The
oxygen appears in small bubbles upon the platinum foil, but
the hydrogen does not immediately make its appearance at
the other pole, for, by combination with the chlorine and
oxygen contained in the bronzes, free hydrochloric acid
and water are formed. The hydrochloric acid in turn acts
upon the potassium cyanide to form potassium chloride and
hydrocyanic acid, both of which substances are dissolved
in the water of the bath. The hydrocyanic acid can
often be recognised in the room by its characteristic smell
of bitter almonds. The process may be expressed by
the following equations (neglecting the water produced by
the oxygen of the oxide, which is of no importance in the
process):
</p>


<p class="chem-eq">
CuCl<sub>2</sub> + 2H = Cu + 2HCl,<br />
HCl + KCN = KCl + HCN.
</p>

<p>
Although the chief portion of the potassium chloride and
hydrocyanic acid are dissolved in the bath, the remaining
traces of these substances must be removed by very carefully
washing the bronze in water, after which it should be dried,
and if necessary finally subjected to impregnation.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127' href='#Page_127'>
[127]</a></span>
Some further observations may be made in connection
with the practical application of this process.
</p>

<p>
Of course, other primary batteries may be used instead of
the Daniell cells, but these latter may be specially recommended
for the ease with which they can be procured and for the
steadiness of their action. Information concerning the method
of filling and using them may be obtained at any shop where
they are sold. The copper wire and platinum wire should
not be too thin, but must be at least from 1 to 2 mm. in
thickness: they should be fastened together by binding-screws,
and care must be taken that both the wire ends and the
screws have clean surfaces. Glass vessels or glass cylinders
are most suitable because the process of reduction can be
watched, but large objects will of course require glazed
earthenware baths. If wooden boxes are used they must be
coated inside with paraffin wax. The strength of the cyanide
solution should be 2%. Having a large number of reductions
to carry out, I keep a 20% stock solution in a large bottle,
one part of which is diluted with nine parts of water when
required for use. Potassium cyanide is, as is well known, a
strong poison, and care should therefore be taken to prevent
access to any sore or cut on the hands; this can be done by
the use of india-rubber finger stalls or gloves.
</p>

<p>
If the bronze object is neither too large nor too heavy it
may be suspended in the bath by looping the platinum wire
over the edge of the vessel. It is a convenient plan to use
different coloured wires to distinguish the negative and
positive poles of the battery, but should any doubt arise as to
which wire should be connected with the bronze or which
with the platinum, the following test will readily decide the
question. Moisten a small piece of white filter paper with a
drop of a solution of potassium iodide<a name='FA_143' id='FA_143'
href='#FN_143' class='fnanchor'>[143]</a>, and touch the two
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128' href='#Page_128'>
[128]</a></span>
conducting wires with it simultaneously: a brown spot will
be seen on the paper at the point of contact with one of the
wires; this is the positive wire, and must therefore be connected
with the platinum. If the current is passing through
the cyanide bath and the bronze, bubbles of gas will appear
upon the platinum foil, or the products of the decomposition
of the potassium cyanide may change the colour of the bath
near the platinum to yellow or brown, while at the same time
cloudy streaks under the bronze will show where the potassium
chloride and hydrocyanic acid, resulting from the reduction
of the copper compounds, are meeting with the cyanide of the
bath. If the platinum wire is not firmly fixed round the
bronze, hydrogen may be formed upon it, and should this
occur the wire should be drawn tighter.
</p>

<p>
Whilst the reduction is going on it is advisable to renew
the potassium cyanide at least once, or even several times,
if large and greatly oxidized bronzes are under treatment, for
otherwise all the potassium cyanide may be consumed by the
changes in progress; this can be ascertained with certainty
by a smell of chlorine. When the bath requires renewal the
bronze may be taken out with a pair of metal tongs, or if too
large, two strong copper wires should be passed underneath
it, the ends of which are wound round a strong glass rod
or wooden stick. The bronze should then be well rinsed or
brushed with a soft brush before it is put into the fresh
bath.
</p>

<p>
Bronzes are frequently met with which are much deformed
by an earthy or sandy layer cemented by oxide. These
incrustations can be partly removed by a preliminary treatment
with dilute hydrochloric acid, but the bronze must be
afterwards carefully rinsed with water or even steeped to
prevent unnecessary decomposition of the cyanide by the acid.
Before reduction it is useful to secure thorough penetration
by placing the vessel containing the solution and the bronze
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129' href='#Page_129'>
[129]</a></span>
under a bell glass attached to an air pump, as has been
previously explained (p. <a href="#Page_68">68</a>).
</p>

<p>
During the process of reduction small whitish-green
crystalline needles often collect on the platinum foil, but
although in large numbers they are so minute that it has not
been possible hitherto to determine their composition; they
seem to contain copper and cyanogen. After some time the
platinum becomes covered with a whitish-green or brownish
deposit, which should be removed by rinsing in water and
brushing; if this should not succeed the platinum must be
dipped in hydrochloric acid, rinsed with water, and rubbed
with fine sand. The glass vessel may be cleaned in the same
way.
</p>

<p>
The reduction is complete when all the chlorine, previously
combined with the metal, has combined with the hydrogen
produced by the electrolysis of the water. There being no
further chlorine with which the hydrogen produced by the
continued action of the current may unite, the completion of
the process is marked by the appearance of bubbles of that
gas upon the surface of the bronze. The bubbles which rise
from beneath often mark out the outlines of the object upon
the surface of the bath.
</p>

<p>
Before the bronze is washed it should be placed in a
fresh cyanide bath, but of 1% strength only. For large
and especially for thick objects, this bath must be renewed
several times, so as to allow the washing process to begin in
the bath itself whilst the current is still passing through it.
Care should also be taken that every side of the object in turn
faces the platinum foil for some time, for if one side remains
turned toward the platinum throughout the process, it will
sometimes assume the red tint of copper, while the rest of the
bronze retains a somewhat dark colour.
</p>

<p>
When finally removed from the reducing bath, after the
black metallic powder has been thoroughly cleaned off with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130' href='#Page_130'>
[130]</a></span>
water and a soft brush, the object should be suspended for a
short time in water at the ordinary temperature, or so fixed
that there is a good depth of water beneath it; it should then
be washed in hot water. When the bronze is first placed in
water, whether hot or lukewarm, small bubbles of hydrogen will
continue to rise for some time, while at the same time a whitish,
or sometimes grey, gelatinous precipitate, consisting of a
hydrated oxide of tin<a name='FA_144' id='FA_144' href='#FN_144'
class='fnanchor'>[144]</a>, will often fall from it. The grey colour
is caused by the admixture of small particles of lead or copper.
</p>

<p>
At first I renew the water two or three times a day, then
once in twenty-four hours, and finally at longer intervals,
using distilled water throughout for small objects, but for
larger specimens for the final washings only. For the earlier
washings at any rate I use warm water. Cyanides as well as
chlorides give a white precipitate with silver nitrate; this
reagent will therefore serve to indicate the progress of the
operation. If at the end of a fortnight in the case of small
bronzes, or in three to six weeks for large objects, the water
shows no cloudiness, or if upon the addition of yellow
potassium chromate it instantly assumes a red colour (p.
<a href="#Page_62">62</a>),
the steeping may be considered complete. Some Egyptian
bronzes, especially those which contain a large proportion of
lead, after steeping exhibit a whitish crystalline coating of
lead carbonate or small hemispherical groups of crystals
scattered over the surface of the metal, especially where the
pores are large; when dry these can easily be removed.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131' href='#Page_131'>
[131]</a></span>
An extended experience points to the conclusion that
bronzes should be dried at once, and as quickly as possible.
They should be wiped with soft cloths and then dried in a
drying chamber or upon glass or metal rings on a stove. A
simple form of drying chamber can be made with copper or
iron plate of sufficient thickness, with a loose lid provided
with a hole fitted with a cork, through which a thermometer
passes. This can be heated over a Bunsen burner, but the
temperature should not exceed 230&deg;F. [110&deg;C.]. Small
objects may be freed from water by immersion in alcohol for
twenty-four hours before drying.
</p>

<p>
The completion of the process may be gauged by the
yellowish or reddish yellow colour which the bronzes should
assume when they have been dried and wiped with a cloth
or brushed; brushes made of the finest steel wire may be used
for this purpose. A bright colour is but rarely seen on
bronzes which contain lead. Egyptian bronzes frequently
contain as much as 20% of lead, and such bronzes have
nearly always a dull-grey or blackish appearance. A similar
colour is seen on bronzes which contain no lead, but which
are very porous, and are in an advanced state of decomposition.
In such cases the finely divided particles of reduced
metal are retained upon the rough surface of the bronze, and
as all metals, when sufficiently finely divided, form a blackish
powder without any metallic lustre, the whole object then
appears almost black. It is difficult, and in many cases impossible,
to remove this dust, especially that retained in the pores.
Metal dust is injurious to the lungs, and if recourse is had to
brushing, an efficient extractor for the removal of the dust-filled
air is required<a name='FA_145' id='FA_145' href='#FN_145'
class='fnanchor'>[145]</a>; but brushing and the use of bellows
in addition frequently prove insufficient. Washing the objects
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132' href='#Page_132'>
[132]</a></span>
with benzine is more effectual, but a trustworthy method of
giving the bronze a better appearance is to place it into
melted paraffin wax<a name='FA_146' id='FA_146' href='#FN_146'
class='fnanchor'>[146]</a> at 250&deg;to 285&deg;F. [120&deg; to
140&deg;C.]. Yet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133' href='#Page_133'>
[133]</a></span>
the use of paraffin wax should be avoided if possible, for in
spite of the most careful washing blue efflorescences may
sometimes appear upon thick bronzes in the course of a year.
If this should happen they must be washed out at once, and
the bronze can again be submitted to the cyanide-reduction
process. If however paraffin wax had been applied an attempt
would have to be made to remove it by immersing the bronze
in benzine or a mixture of ether and alcohol, or by heating,
before the reduction process could be repeated.

There is no doubt that these bright-blue efflorescences are
the result of an incomplete reduction, which in many cases
can scarcely be remedied, for it is often impossible thoroughly
to wash objects of great thickness. Thin bronzes, bronze
plate, and copper plate remain free from efflorescences. Moreover,
many bronzes, especially Egyptian ones, have a hard,
non-metallic core, which in the casting has been partly fused
or at least hard-burnt, and resists the effects of the washing.

<p>
It is occasionally found that a bronze cannot stand the
process of reduction, either because there is only a thin layer
of metal over a stout core, or because the metal is permeated
with cuprous oxide, which when tested with a file has a
metallic appearance. The bronze must therefore be continually
watched whilst it is in the cyanide bath, and if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135' href='#Page_135'>
[135]</a></span>
necessary should be taken out even before the reduction is
complete. This should be done if large pieces or large
quantities of a powdery precipitate fall from the bronze, or
if it is found that a needle readily pierces the oxidized layer.
A specimen of this kind must be taken from the bath, carefully
steeped, dried, and impregnated<a name='FA_148' id='FA_148' href='#FN_148' class='fnanchor'>[148]</a>.
</p>

<p>
It is not to be expected that bronzes which are in an
advanced state of decomposition (e.g. Figs. <a href="#Fig_9">9</a>-<a
href="#Fig_12">12</a>) can be so
transformed by reduction as to appear as they did when they
left the artist&rsquo;s hand. For, although the decomposed oxidized
layer is now reduced to metal, this no longer forms a coherent
mass, but a loose powder, which, being deprived of its
essential constituents, chlorine, oxygen and carbonic acid,
no longer retains its coherency, but falls to the bottom.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136' href='#Page_136'>
[136]</a></span>
Only in the interior and in the pores is the reduced metal
retained.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the preservation of articles by the removal
of the injurious chlorine compounds (as is also the case with
Blell&rsquo;s and with Krefting&rsquo;s method for iron antiquities), the
process may result in the discovery of inlaid work, inscriptions
or ornamentation, the presence of which was not suspected.
The accompanying illustrations (Figs. <a href="#Fig_39">39</a> and <a
href="#Fig_40">40</a>) show bronzes
before and after the preservation process, while the axe-blade
shown in Figs. <a href="#Fig_41">41</a>-<a href="#Fig_43">43</a>
illustrates equally clearly the advantages
which accrue from the treatment. Not less striking is the
result of the treatment in the case of the dagger-sheath shown
in Figs. <a href="#Fig_44">44</a> and <a href="#Fig_45">45</a> by which
the design was discovered.
</p>

Reference may here be made to a case described elsewhere<a name='FA_149'

in which reduction proved that what had been thought a

<a id='Page_138' name='Page_138' href='#Page_138'>[138]</a></span>
did not belong to each other, but were fitted together by
means of a bottle cork of modern date! In another instance
a bronze was found upon reduction to be brazed with a hard
solder containing zinc, which was thus quite inconsistent
with the age ascribed to the object.

<p>
A short digression may be here made in order to discuss the
question whether the composition of the bronzes undergoes
any alteration. Three analyses<a name='FA_150' id='FA_150'
href='#FN_150' class='fnanchor'>[150]</a> of Egyptian bronzes before
and after reduction by Finkener&rsquo;s method show that the
change in composition is so slight as to be immaterial. It is
of course obvious that greater differences will be seen in the
results of the analyses before and after reduction of bronzes
which are in an advanced state of oxidation, for in this case
chlorine, oxygen, water, and carbonic acid constitute an
appreciable proportion of the total weight. But even in
these cases the analysis made after the reduction shows very
slight variation from that of the original metal.

The two latter bronzes were tested qualitatively only for
arsenic and antimony, and when the three objects were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139' href='#Page_139'>
[139]</a></span>
washed the hydrated tin-oxide described on p. <a href="#Page_130">130</a>
was only
found in the case of the Ibis. In this connection it should
not be forgotten that slight differences in the quantities may
be due to errors in the analysis as well as to a want of
homogeneity in the alloy.
</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Krefting&rsquo;s Method.</span> This method is similar to
that used
for the reduction of iron (see page <a href="#Page_108">108</a>). The
layer of oxidized
material is removed in several places by filing, hammering, or
rubbing with emery cloth until the metal is exposed. The
object is then wrapped round with strips of zinc, and placed
in a 5% solution of caustic soda. The hydrochloric acid produced
in the process of reduction acts upon the soda to form
sodium chloride. Here too the greatest care must be taken
that the steeping is sufficient.
</p>

<p>
Personally I prefer Finkener&rsquo;s method, for potassium
cyanide is more easily washed out than soda, and also, although
poisonous, is less caustic.
</p>

<p>
Krefting&rsquo;s method however has proved of considerable
success in some cases, notably in the treatment of some
40-50,000 Roman copper coins at the Berlin Museum. These
were, with few exceptions, covered with a crystalline layer
resembling green malachite or blue azurite and were quite
illegible. Various unsatisfactory attempts were made to clean
them with ammonia, with warm and cold acids of different
kinds, with acid and iron nails, and by electric current both
in an acid solution and in a solution of potassium cyanide.
The following method finally proved satisfactory<a name='FA_151'

<span class='subh'>Krefting&rsquo;s Method Applied to Oxidized Copper
Coins.</span>
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
&ldquo;A thin plate of zinc with a bright metallic surface
is perforated with a brad-awl, having a diameter of from
2 to 5 mm., until there are about 50 or 60 holes in each
square metre. This is placed with the sharp edges of the
holes uppermost on a row of glass rings (or crystallizing
dishes will serve the purpose) 20 mm. in height resting
upon the bottom of a large glass vessel. The coins,
which in this case were 20 mm. in diameter, were then
placed on the zinc plate, so that 7 or 8 of them occupy
a space of 1 square decimetre. Another similarly perforated
plate is laid upon them, and upon this more coins
are arranged in the same way, and so on until there are
six or eight double layers. A perforated zinc plate is
then placed on the top with the sharp edges of the holes
turned downwards, and over this a few zinc plates which
have been previously used. The whole pile is surmounted
with weights or stones resting upon glass rings or
inverted glass dishes in order to press the sharp edges
of the holes into the closest possible contact with the
coins. A 5% solution of caustic soda is then poured
over the whole, the immediate result of which is an
evolution of gas. The reduction of the coins is usually
complete in fifteen to eighteen hours, after which they
should be well washed. After several rinsings in cold
water they are placed, about 1000 at a time, in a large
vessel fitted with a perforated false bottom containing
hot water, which should be renewed three or four
times every day. After four days the coins are wiped
with a cloth and thoroughly dried on a warm oven plate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141' href='#Page_141'>
[141]</a></span>
or in a drying chamber at a temperature of about 212&deg;F.
[100&deg;C.]. They are then brushed with a bristle brush
before a dust extractor, a procedure rendered necessary
by the fine metallic dust from the coins, which then
assume a light or dark brown colour such as is seen on
copper coins which are in actual circulation. The practice
of placing the coins whilst still wet into melted paraffin
wax at 260&deg;F. [120&deg;-130&deg;C.], which gives a dark appearance
even to the brightest, has the disadvantage that
the wax prevents the use of sealing-wax for taking
impressions, and is therefore not recommended.
</p>

<p>
The reaction is analogous to that which occurs in the
reduction of iron. The copper of the coin forms in the
alkaline solution an electric couple with the zinc, and
the hydrogen which forms at the copper end reduces the
copper compounds covering the coins to metallic copper,
and thereby loosens them, while the zinc oxide which is
simultaneously formed is dissolved in the soda solution.
In actual practice a part only of the zinc oxide is dissolved,
while the remainder forms a white coating on
the zinc<a name='FA_152' id='FA_152' href='#FN_152' class='fnanchor'>
[152]</a>. Experience shows that a 4-5% solution is
the most suitable for this method of reduction, which
gives the most favourable results when these details are
followed. If for example the zinc plate is laid immediately
on the bottom of the glass trough, if the coins
are laid too close together on the plate, or if there are
more than 6 to 8 double layers in a trough, the process
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142' href='#Page_142'>
[142]</a></span>
of reduction is often incomplete, and it is then necessary
to treat the coins a second time. It is scarcely necessary
to mention that larger coins must be placed at proportionately
greater distances from each other.
</p>

<p>
The 40-50,000 coins which were thus treated had
originally been tinned, but the tin only remained at a
few places. When the coins were washed immediately
after the reduction, this tin could still be clearly distinguished,
but on further washing, drying, and brushing,
it ceased to be visible on account of the dark colour
imparted to it by the finely powdered copper. In one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143' href='#Page_143'>
[143]</a></span>
or two cases lead appeared on the surface of the coin,
but was easily removed by mechanical means.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Using a pair of tongs, dip the coins one by one
into melted lead until the crackling, which begins at
once, has ceased, which occurs in from 3 to 10 seconds.
The hand should be protected with a glove from the
spluttering molten lead. The coin is then thrown into
cold water, cleaned, and placed until the next day in hot
milk. It may be necessary to repeat the process when
the coin has become cold. By this method an olive
colour is imparted to the coin which many antiquaries
prefer to dark brown, but personally I prefer Krefting&rsquo;s
method because it renders the inscription and designs
far more distinct. A coin which after the treatment
with melted lead has remained so covered with cupric
oxide as to be still illegible can seldom be improved by a
repetition of the treatment, whereas had the zinc treatment
been applied in the first instance the result would
probably have been satisfactory. This conclusion seems
to be justified by the extremely small percentage of
coins which, in my experience, have remained illegible
after the treatment by electrical methods.&rdquo;

<b>(C.)</b> <span class='subh'>Preservation of Bronzes by the Exclusion
of Air.</span>
</p>

<p>
In those cases in which the advanced state of decomposition
renders the reduction process either inapplicable or
at any rate inadvisable, or in which the decay is not likely
to be arrested by impregnation, a further method of preservation
remains, viz. the complete exclusion of air and moisture.
</p>

<p>
If air is completely freed from moisture the oxygen can
no longer act in conjunction with the copper chloride upon
the still intact metal (see page <a href="#Page_29">29</a>
<i>et seq.</i>), and the condition
of the bronze will consequently remain unchanged.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145' href='#Page_145'>
[145]</a></span>
A bronze, for example, which shows much decay should
be placed after impregnation under a hermetically sealed
bell glass, and beneath or near it should be placed some
dehydrating agent, of which anhydrous calcium chloride is
the most suitable (see note, p. <a href="#Page_123">123</a>). To exclude
the air completely
the bell glass should have a projecting ground edge,
which should be smeared with vaseline or grease and pressed
firmly upon a thick well polished glass plate. The dehydrating
agent may be placed in a glass vessel or dish in such a
way as to be unseen, or it may be covered with two or three
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146' href='#Page_146'>
[146]</a></span>
thicknesses of dark gauze or with black cardboard laid loosely
over it. If an object is too large for a bell glass, or if several
objects are to be exhibited together, a square plate-glass case
with iron framework, made air-tight with putty, may be used
as shown in the illustration (Fig. <a href="#Fig_48">48</a>). The lower
part, containing
calcium chloride, is partitioned off by a perforated
plate covered with black gauze<a name='FA_154' id='FA_154' href='#FN_154'
class='fnanchor'>[154]</a>. A hygrometer was placed
behind the head, the indicator of which has remained at zero
since it was first fixed several years ago, and the bronze has
not hitherto shown any sign of change, although the inlaid
gold is in parts raised from the metal by a light-green
oxychloride. The cost of these cases is considerable, but for
valuable objects this should not be considered. In the place
of calcium chloride, sticks or lumps of caustic soda may be
used with advantage, for this substance absorbs both moisture
and carbonic acid.

<h2>
<span class='smcap'>Appendix.</span><br />
<span class='smcap'>Methods of Bringing out Worn Lettering
upon Coins.</span>
</h2>

<p>
These methods are founded upon the fact that the sunken
areas of the coin are, by the pressure of the die in stamping,
rendered denser than the raised portions, such as the inscription.
The earliest method is that published by Brewster,
reported by S&uuml;pke<a name='FA_155' id='FA_155' href='#FN_155'
class='fnanchor'>[155]</a>. The coins when cleaned are placed upon
red-hot iron, which causes the oxidation of the entire surface
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147' href='#Page_147'>
[147]</a></span>
of the coin. The thin film of oxides varies in colour according
to the duration and the intensity of the heat. The oxidation
of the letters of the inscription differs from that of the surrounding
parts, and is recognisable by a difference in colour.
Drude<a name='FA_156' id='FA_156' href='#FN_156' class='fnanchor'>
[156]</a>, treating more especially of silver coins, remarks
that the inscription is rendered legible by heating them to
redness over a Bunsen-burner. It then, according to &ldquo;Prometheus<a
name='FA_157' id='FA_157' href='#FN_157' class='fnanchor'>[157]</a>,&rdquo;
when viewed in a dark room, appears dark on a
bright ground, especially if the coin has been previously
polished and then roughened again by slightly etching it with
acid. In conclusion, the method of Roux<a name='FA_158' id='FA_158'
href='#FN_158' class='fnanchor'>[158]</a> may be quoted:
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
&ldquo;The smooth-worn and polished coin is placed in a solution
of copper sulphate or of some other metallic salt, and
suspended between the electrodes of one or more cells of
a battery (any other form of continuous current will
serve the purpose). If the current is weak, the electrodes
must be near to the coin. The stronger the current the
more rapidly the impression appears. On the side
which faces the anode or positive plate the impression
is metallic; on the other side, after gently wiping off the
less firmly adherent part of the oxide, the impression
appears in grey lines. These markings can be fixed by
varnishing them with a thin alcoholic solution of shellac.
To render the impression legible on both sides, the coin
should be placed upon the four upturned feet of an
insulating stand. The larger the coin the deeper must
be the layer of solution above and below the coin. The
depth below should be equal to the radius of the coin.
</p>

<p>
This can perhaps be most conveniently carried out
by placing that electrode in immediate contact with the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148' href='#Page_148'>
[148]</a></span>
coin which upon immersion in the solution becomes
tarnished with the metal, i.e. the cathode or negative
pole. Other portions which it is not intended to treat
should be first covered with varnish.
</p>

<p>
The striking success of this method is due to the
fact that that portion of the metal which has been
compressed by the stamp is a better electrical conductor
than the rest; no success could therefore be expected
from the use of this process for the restoration of such
objects as worn engraved copper-plates, etc.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>


<h3>
(<i>j</i>) <span class='smcap'>Silver.</span>
</h3>

<p>
Preservative treatment of silver is scarcely necessary (cp.
pp. <a href="#Page_49">49</a>-<a href="#Page_52">52</a>), except in those
cases in which the silver is alloyed
with a large percentage of copper, and which show efflorescences
similar to those which appear upon bronzes containing
chlorine. Electrolytic reduction will be found to be the most
suitable method of treatment in such cases. To treat silver
coins they should be placed in contact with iron nails in
lemon juice. Instead of the citric acid, which is the active
principle in this process, other diluted acids and other metals,
e.g. zinc, may be employed. Flinders Petrie<a name='FA_159' id='FA_159'
href='#FN_159' class='fnanchor'>[159]</a> has shown that
the reduction can also be effected by a weak solution of
common salt. Silver chloride is soluble in ammonia, and
thin layers may be removed by the application of ammonia
by means of a soft brush. Thorough rinsing with pure water,
drying with soft cloths, and cautious warming are always
essential.
</p>

<p>
An excellent reducing agent for single coins, the characters
of which are rendered illegible by a layer of silver chloride,
is molten potassium cyanide, or a mixture of this substance
with sodium or potassium carbonate. In a short time the
silver chloride is decomposed and removed from the smooth
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149' href='#Page_149'>
[149]</a></span>
surface of the coin. After boiling out with water, steeping
in alcohol, drying, and brushing with a soft brush, the coins
may be coated with zapon. Coins treated in this way appear
to be less brittle than those reduced by Krefting&rsquo;s method.
More troublesome but less dangerous, because potassium
cyanide is not used, is the treatment of silver coins with a
fused mixture of potassium and sodium carbonates. In this
case the silver chloride is converted into silver carbonate,
which is then decomposed with 50% acetic acid. Further
treatment by washing, drying, and impregnation is carried
out as previously described.
</p>

<p>
Silver which has become friable (p. <a href="#Page_51">51</a>) can be
rendered
more compact by cautiously heating it to redness. It will
however be advisable to entrust heating and mechanical
treatment of objects which are much bent to some skilled
silversmith, whose experience may prevent disaster. Silver
objects which are largely converted into friable chloride,
especially if they are much expanded, or if large portions
have broken away in the process of removing the chloride,
will hardly bear any other treatment than that of impregnation
with gum-dammar solution or with paraffin wax. As
silver chloride is easily fused such articles should not be
subjected to heat.
</p>

<p>
Earthy matter can often be removed with a neutral soap
and warm water, while calcareous accretions can be dissolved
by a 2% solution of hydrochloric acid. Silver which has
been blackened by silver sulphide may be laid in a warm 2%
solution of potassium cyanide. All objects should be subsequently
well washed with warm water.
</p>


<h3>
(<i>k</i>) <span class='smcap'>Lead and Tin.</span>
</h3>

<p>
Objects of pure lead and pure tin are rare. If much
oxidized they should be washed with warm water, dried, and
impregnated with a gum-dammar solution or with paraffin
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150' href='#Page_150'>
[150]</a></span>
wax (pp. <a href="#Page_70">70</a> and <a href="#Page_91">91</a>). If in a
good state of preservation they
may be freed from any earthy or calcareous coating or from
lead carbonate by the cautious use of very dilute nitric acid
followed by steeping in water.
</p>

<p>
Ceresole<a name='FA_160' id='FA_160' href='#FN_160' class='fnanchor'>
[160]</a> cleans oxidized leaden seals with 10% acetic acid,
neutralises the acid with ammonia, and after five minutes in
alcohol coats them thinly with wax. The seals are preserved
between glass dishes (Petri dishes), the space between the
dishes being filled with cement. I employ Krefting&rsquo;s method
for leaden medals, using either zinc and very dilute sulphuric
acid, or zinc dust and caustic soda. Occasionally the zinc
dust becomes firmly cemented by oxide to the surface of the
lead, and, if this is the case, great care must be used in
removing it. The washing process also requires care. A very
efficacious method is to allow a stream of warm distilled
water, from which the dissolved air has been driven off by
boiling, to flow over the object in a porcelain dish. I now
omit any impregnation with paraffin wax, and instead recommend
removal of the water by alcohol, drying, and coating
with zapon. To preserve the specimens after treatment, more
especially from the injurious action of perspiration from the
hands, they are placed between dishes of glass or of celluloid<a
name='FA_161' id='FA_161' href='#FN_161' class='fnanchor'>[161]</a>.
</p>

<h3>
(<i>l</i>) <span class='smcap'>Gold.</span>
</h3>

<p>
Objects of pure gold usually need only be cleaned with
soap and water and a soft brush; lime may be removed by
the application of a 2% solution of hydrochloric acid. A
coating of silver chloride occurring on gold which contains a
large percentage of silver may be removed by ammonia, or,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151' href='#Page_151'>
[151]</a></span>
in certain cases, by the alternate use of dilute hydrochloric
acid and ammonia.
</p>

<p>
A layer of red ferric oxide (see p. <a href="#Page_53">53</a>) is of
frequent
occurrence upon gold objects, and may be removed by warming
the object in a stronger solution of hydrochloric acid, but
soft brushes will often serve the same purpose. Pure gold
being very soft, only the softest so-called &ldquo;silver brushes&rdquo;
should be used, and all pressure or bending should be avoided.
If friable the object should be carefully impregnated with a
solution of gum-dammar (p. <a href="#Page_70">70</a>).
</p>


<h3>
(<i>m</i>) <span class='smcap'>Glass and Enamel.</span>
</h3>

<p>
If covered with a film of dirt, or if when in a collection
objects of glass or enamel undergo any alteration, they should
be washed or steeped in lukewarm water. When dry they
should be treated with pure olive oil or poppy-seed oil, which
may be diluted with benzine. The oil helps to restore the lustre
to the glass and to bring out the colour of the enamel. When
thus treated the objects should be carefully protected from
dust.
</p>

<p>
A decomposition of ancient glass when deposited in a
museum has been hitherto only rarely observed, but allusion
may be here made to the so-called &lsquo;sweating&rsquo; of glass which
is a question of considerable importance in Industrial-Art
collections. In this case preservation is insured by washing
with distilled water, drying, and coating with zapon. Further
particulars may be obtained from the paper by Pazaurek<a name='FA_162'

II. <span class='smcap'>Preservation of Organic Substances.</span>
</h2>


<h3>
(<i>n</i>) <span class='smcap'>Bones, Horns, Ivory.</span>
</h3>

<p>
Many curators dry carefully and impregnate them with a
gum-dammar solution or shellac; isinglass or glue are however
preferable, for these aqueous solutions may be used for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152' href='#Page_152'>
[152]</a></span>
the treatment of damp objects, which could scarcely be dried
without cracking. In order to permeate the object these
solutions must be very dilute, and are most advantageously
applied at a temperature of about 120&deg;F. [50&deg;C.]. The
impregnation may also be effected in rarefied air under a bell
glass (p. <a href="#Page_68">68</a>). Friable bones and similar objects
which might
fall to pieces in the solution during impregnation should be
bound with strips of gauze or with string before immersion;
they are easily removed when cold. To prevent the formation
of mould a small quantity of dissolved corrosive sublimate<a name='FA_163'
id='FA_163' href='#FN_163' class='fnanchor'>[163]</a>
is added to the glue, or when dry after impregnation the
objects may be covered with a solution of shellac or resin.
Impregnation is of very general application, and is frequently
used for the preservation of fossil and pleistocene bones.
</p>


<h3>
(<i>o</i>) <span class='smcap'>Leather.</span>
</h3>

<p>
At Copenhagen the method used to render leather soft
and pliable is to place it in train oil for an hour and then
dry it with filter-paper. Lanoline may also be used with
success<a name='FA_164' id='FA_164' href='#FN_164' class='fnanchor'>
[164]</a>. Poppy-seed oil in benzine (p. <a href="#Page_86">86</a>) is
said to produce
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153' href='#Page_153'>
[153]</a></span>
good results, but the &ldquo;Merkbuch&rdquo; recommends the preservation
of leather in this condition in alcohol<a name='FA_165' id='FA_165'
href='#FN_165' class='fnanchor'>[165]</a>.
</p>


<h3>
(<i>p</i>) <span class='smcap'>Textile Fabrics, Hair.</span>
</h3>

<p>
Earth and soil may be removed by mechanical means, and,
occasionally, careful washing may be possible. The objects
should be dried and impregnated with a gum-dammar solution
(p. <a href="#Page_70">70</a>), poppy-seed oil (p.
<a href="#Page_86">86</a>), or a solution of india-rubber
(p. <a href="#Page_90">90</a>), or they may be preserved in alcohol (p.
<a href="#Page_159">159</a>).
Some textile fabrics in the Copenhagen Museum owe their
excellent state of preservation to Steffensen&rsquo;s treatment, i.e.
impregnation with a solution of india-rubber in turpentine
with the addition of bees&rsquo;-wax.
</p>

<p>
The following account of the treatment of textile fabrics
from the Lake-Dwellings is due to Herr Heierli, of Z&uuml;rich:
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
&ldquo;The pieces as they were taken up were laid on the
ground and thus slowly allowed to dry in the air. They
were then placed between glass plates, the edges of which
were pasted over with paper. Old pieces which had been
dry for a long time, and which had become tender and
friable, were laid on the ground and watered from time
to time until they were soaked through; they were then
treated in the manner already described.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154' href='#Page_154'>
[154]</a></span>
Egyptian textile fabrics preserved between glass plates
often deposit a thin layer of salt on the glass, but this is
easily wiped off (see p. <a href="#Page_155">155</a>). It must first be
ascertained by
a previous trial in each case whether the salt can be removed
by steeping in water or in alcohol and water.
</p>

<p>
Hair found in peat has always a dark-brown colour from
impregnation with peaty matter. The method proposed
by Bille Gram<a name='FA_166' id='FA_166' href='#FN_166' class='fnanchor'>
[166]</a> for restoring the natural colour consists of
repeated and alternate treatment with very dilute alkali
solution and acid at about 120&deg;F. [50&deg;C.]. When the liquid
ceases to show coloration the natural colour of the hair is
restored.
</p>


<h3>
(<i>q</i>) <span class='smcap'>Feathers.</span>
</h3>

<p>
These do not require any treatment beyond protection
against insects, which is attained by immersion in an alcoholic
solution of corrosive sublimate, or by spraying with corrosive
sublimate in either alcoholic or aqueous solution. Of course
the poisonous nature of corrosive sublimate necessitates
caution in its use and it should be always labelled as such.
</p>

<p>
The use of naphthalene is not always successful, and white
scales of naphthalene are apt to make their appearance; nor
does finely powdered pepper sprinkled on the feathers, either
alone or mixed with finely powdered alum, give satisfactory
results.
</p>


<h3>
(<i>r</i>) <span class='smcap'>Papyrus.</span>
</h3>

<p>
The method of cleaning and preserving papyrus in use in
the Egyptian department of the Royal Museums at Berlin is
as follows: Those pieces which are folded together or rolled
are carefully straightened, and, if very friable, they are first
placed between damp filter paper to render them uniformly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155' href='#Page_155'>
[155]</a></span>
pliable. Dust and dirt are removed with soft paint-brushes,
crystals of salt which are often found<a name='FA_167' id='FA_167'
href='#FN_167' class='fnanchor'>[167]</a> are picked off with
forceps. Any growths of fungus are carefully scraped off
with a knife. The papyrus thus prepared is then placed
between two thick polished glass plates, the two opposing
surfaces of which are covered with a very thin layer of vaseline.
Air is frequently admitted to dry the papyrus, while
the pressure of the glass plates tends to smooth it out, and
after it has been so treated it is mounted between thin glass
plates, the edges of which are pasted over with paper covered
with an oil paint.
</p>

<p>
A papyrus preserved between glass plates often shows round
the edges a whitish border about two millimetres in breadth,
and on separation the glass plates show a slight film of the
same white material on the surface which had been in contact
with the papyrus. The formation of this film, which consists
chiefly of common salt and is easily wiped off, may be prevented
by previously washing the papyrus in distilled water,
a proceeding which experience has shown to be harmless.
As the papyrus will swim on the surface it should first be
immersed in alcohol until soaked through; the process of
steeping is then quite simple. The thinness of papyrus
enables the steeping to be completed after 24 to 48 hours
by two changes of the water, and care must be taken
lest a too prolonged steeping should obliterate the lettering.
The water assumes a yellowish or brown tint and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156' href='#Page_156'>
[156]</a></span>
papyrus becomes somewhat lighter in colour on drying.
Papyrus may also be preserved by zapon (see Appendix),
but this method has no advantage over that of mounting
between glass plates.
</p>


<h3>
(<i>s</i>) <span class='smcap'>Wood.</span>
</h3>

<p>
To preserve adequately articles of moist wood (and they
are generally in this condition when first excavated), preliminary
measures to prevent their drying in the air must be
taken immediately after they are dug out of the earth. If
found in water, as for instance articles from pile-dwellings,
they should be conveyed in water; moist objects should be
wrapped in several thicknesses of moist cloth, and the whole
wrapped in gutta-percha membrane, or in a layer of moist
moss. The cracks which arise in wooden objects which have
become dried may frequently be closed up by laying them in
lukewarm water.
</p>

<p>
As the earliest attempts at preservation were probably
made upon wooden objects there is scarcely a collection in
which a number of methods are not employed. One exception
only is known to me, and here, after a plaster of Paris cast
has been taken, the object is simply allowed to shrink. The
methods proposed and carried out are so different and so
numerous, especially as regards the liquid used for impregnation,
and in such variety, that it is only necessary to deal
with the most important. These may be divided into two
classes, viz. dry and wet.
</p>


<p class="center">
<b>(1)</b> <span class='subh'>Dry Preservation of Wood.</span>
</p>

<p>
Moist or wet objects are placed in thin size or in a solution
of isinglass till they are impregnated, after which they are
dried gradually in a shady place. A solution of shellac, or
varnish diluted with petroleum or benzine, is then put on
with a brush.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157' href='#Page_157'>
[157]</a></span>
Sometimes the objects are placed directly into a mixture
of varnish and petroleum, or they are impregnated with
melted paraffin. The former is preferable as a means of
impregnation if there are cracks or holes, for the superfluous
solution readily drips from the wood when it is taken out,
while paraffin sets too soon to drain out of the cracks, and
thus imparts an unnatural white appearance to the wood.
Owing to the large size of the vessels which would be otherwise
required, paraffin is only useful for small or medium-sized
objects, but when making use of varnish one end of a large
object<a name='FA_168' id='FA_168' href='#FN_168' class='fnanchor'>
[168]</a> may be placed in the mixture while the solution is
repeatedly poured over the object. After two or three
days the opposite end should be placed in the solution. By
repeating this process every part of the object will soon
be thoroughly impregnated.
</p>

<p>
Objects of still greater size, such as a Viking&rsquo;s ship, can
only be preserved by painting the surface. In such cases
it is advisable to begin with dilute varnish so as to allow the
impregnating solution to penetrate as deeply as possible into
the material, instead of merely forming a skin.
</p>

<p>
A solution of waterglass has in one instance been used for
the preservation of a large boat, but the result is not
satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Leiner&rsquo;s Method</span><a name='FA_169' id='FA_169'
href='#FN_169' class='fnanchor'>[169]</a>. The wooden articles are laid in
glycerine mixed with a small percentage of carbolic acid.
The length of time during which they remain in the glycerine
depends upon their size. When taken out they are lightly
wiped and preserved without further treatment. If a growth
of mould should occur it may be washed off.
</p>

<p>
Objects thus treated retain their moist condition and
should therefore be very carefully protected from dust.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158' href='#Page_158'>
[158]</a></span>

<span class='subh'>Speerschneider&rsquo;s Method</span><a name='FA_170'
id='FA_170' href='#FN_170' class='fnanchor'>[170]</a> (cp. p. <a
href="#Page_91">91</a>). Small specimens
are heated for two hours in a mixture of
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
8 parts of rape-seed oil,<br />
1 part of bees&rsquo;-wax,<br />
1 part of pine resin, and<br />
2 parts of benzene.
</p>
</div>

<p class="noi">
Larger objects require a proportionately longer heating, but
the mixture must not be allowed to actually boil. The
moisture rises as steam and causes the solution to bubble.
The bubbling however continues after the moisture has been
driven off; great care must therefore be taken that the heating
is not so prolonged as to cause the object to shrink. The
highly inflammable nature of the mixture renders great
caution necessary, and should it ignite, a lid, which should
always be in readiness, should be put on the vessel. After
impregnation the objects are wrapped in blotting-paper and
laid in ashes for four days to prevent the access of air. The
aim is doubtless to insure thorough absorption of the superfluous
liquid which remains upon the object, which exposure
to air would prevent by causing the mixture to set too
rapidly. The same mixture can be used repeatedly, but each
time two-thirds of the original quantity of benzene must be
added.
</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Herbst&rsquo;s Method</span><a name='FA_171' id='FA_171'
href='#FN_171' class='fnanchor'>[171]</a>. The moist objects are boiled
in a
saturated solution of alum for two hours (hot water dissolves
about 3<span class='nom'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='dem'>2</span>
times its weight of alum), but if they are of some
thickness the time must be proportionately longer. They are
then taken out, and when the alum in crystallizing has made
them more or less firm, the crystals adhering to the surface
are washed off with warm water.
</p>

<p>
When thoroughly dry the wood is brushed over with hot
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159' href='#Page_159'>
[159]</a></span>
linseed oil, which operation is repeated until no more oil is
absorbed. A final thin coating of varnish or shellac is then
given. According to Steffensen, the method followed at
Copenhagen is to lay the objects in warm thin size for a
quarter of an hour after impregnation with alum. This alum-method
is there used for objects of oak, although the &ldquo;Merkbuch&rdquo;
(p. 60) states that only the varnish-petroleum
mixture
should be used for impregnating this class of object.
</p>


<p class="center">
<b>(2)</b> <span class='subh'>Preservation of Wooden Objects in Liquids.</span>
</p>

<p>
The expense entailed by this method renders it applicable
only to articles of small size.
</p>

<p>
The preservation of small objects in a flat vessel, the
bottom of which is covered with glycerine, has the disadvantage
that glycerine extracts organic substances and thus
assumes a brown colour. If glycerine is used the object should
undergo a thorough preliminary steeping, and the glycerine
should be renewed until it remains colourless. Closed
cylinders filled with glycerine or a mixture of glycerine and
water are not convenient because wood nearly always floats
in the liquid. This may be remedied however by the addition
of alcohol.
</p>

<p>
<span class='subh'>Jenner&rsquo;s Method</span><a name='FA_172' id='FA_172'
href='#FN_172' class='fnanchor'>[172]</a>. When the objects have been
thoroughly cleaned with water, pure alcohol, diluted with
water until the specific gravity at 54&deg;F. [12&middot;5&deg;C.] reaches
0&middot;96, is poured over them. After six or eight weeks the
alcohol is poured off and replaced by fresh alcohol of the same
specific gravity. This alcohol is examined in a year&rsquo;s time,
and should always show a specific gravity of 0&middot;96. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160' href='#Page_160'>
[160]</a></span>
alcohol which has been poured off may be filtered, and if
necessary decolourized by animal charcoal; when the specific
gravity has been again raised to 0&middot;96, by the addition of fresh
alcohol, it may be used again.
</p>

<p>
The same process is applicable to textile fabrics, yarn, and
leather.
</p>


<p class="center">
<span class='subh'>Protection against Wood-worms, etc.</span>
</p>

<p>
All the methods mentioned above will destroy insects and
their larvae.
</p>

<p>
In cases in which it is either impossible or undesirable
to use immersion or external application, as for instance in
the treatment of objects of dry wood, the larvae may be
destroyed by dropping petroleum, an aqueous solution of
potassium arsenite, or corrosive sublimate, into the various
small openings. This will also help to prevent further attacks.
</p>

<p>
If solutions are not applied insects may be destroyed by
the vapour of carbon bi-sulphide or of crude benzene. These
liquids, which are sufficiently volatile at the ordinary temperature,
should be placed, together with the objects to be treated,
in a closed box.
</p>

<p>
I have used a similar method for the destruction of wood-worms
in Egyptian coffins. The coffin is placed in a large
wooden box lined with tin plate. The lid, also lined with
tin, is provided with projecting edges, to which strips of felt
are glued. The weight of the lid by compressing the felt is
sufficient to render the box air-tight. Six or eight glass
vessels containing crude benzene are placed at the bottom of
the chest and of the coffin itself. It need scarcely be added
that the box must not be opened near a fire or light, as the
vapour forms an explosive mixture with air; it is in fact
advisable to have no light or fire in the room.
</p>

<p>
Insects can also be killed by naphthalene vapour, but as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161' href='#Page_161'>
[161]</a></span>
naphthalene is insufficiently volatile at ordinary temperatures,
the method above described is more convenient<a name='FA_173' id='FA_173'
href='#FN_173' class='fnanchor'>[173]</a>.
</p>


<p class="center">
<span class='subh'>Preservation and Cleaning of Coloured
Wooden Objects.</span>
</p>

<p>
For objects of this kind materials should not be used
which, like varnish, tend to darken and so to damage the
colours. Gum-dammar solution (page <a href="#Page_70">70</a>) answers the
purpose,
but colourless collodion is better. Colours which are soluble
in water (as is frequently the case with wooden objects from
Egypt) cannot of course be cleaned with water, but benzine
may be applied by means of soft cloths or brushes. Resinous
or pitch-like substances may often be removed from coloured
objects by turpentine mixed with benzine or ether.
</p>

<p>
A method of cleaning gilded or brightly coloured ecclesiastical
figures which is used in the Breslau Museum is the
application of a mixture of copaiba balsam and ammonia.
This method is similar to that used to clean paintings<a name='FA_174'
id='FA_174' href='#FN_174' class='fnanchor'>[174]</a>, the
action of the solution being that of a mild soap.
</p>

<p>
Antiquities which were originally uncoloured, but which
have been subsequently painted, may be cleared of paint by
means of a solution of caustic soda in water or alcohol.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162' href='#Page_162'>
[162]</a></span>
</p>


<h3>
(<i>t</i>) <span class='smcap'>Amber.</span>
</h3>

<p>
After the mechanical removal of any adherent earth and
dust, the specimen should be rubbed carefully backwards
and forwards between the fingers covered with a soft
woollen glove. Particles of soil should be picked out of any
holes and indentations by using a strong horse hair<a name='FA_175'
id='FA_175' href='#FN_175' class='fnanchor'>[175]</a>. It is
then preserved by impregnation with a solution of shellac,
poppy-seed oil, or isinglass (pp. <a href="#Page_70">70</a> and <a
href="#Page_86">86</a>).
</p>

<p>
The following particulars of the method used in Messrs
Stantien and Becker&rsquo;s collection of amber have been supplied
by Prof. Klebs:
</p>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>
&ldquo;Amber is preserved best in distilled water: I add
a very small quantity of glycerine and a still smaller
amount of alcohol. A proportion of alcohol greater than
1% is injurious to the amber. A thick layer of gelatine
containing glycerine is an excellent medium for the
preservation of large objects if they are kept free from
dust. This layer should be washed off and renewed every
few years.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>


<h2>
<span class='smcap'>The Care of Antiquities after Preservative
Treatment.</span>
</h2>

<p>
In addition to the protection from dust afforded by closed
glass cases, it is also important to protect objects from the
action of direct sunlight, especially during the summer months.
There is, for instance, no doubt that the decay of bronzes,
even of those with a patina which is apparently sound, is
hastened by the great variations of temperature, caused by the
rays of the sun falling directly upon them. Similarly objects
which have been preserved by the application of solutions of
resin or varnish should be protected from the direct access of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163' href='#Page_163'>
[163]</a></span>
sunlight, for the sudden warming may easily cause cracks.
Nor should antiquities be kept near the heating apparatus.
There is another precaution, to which too little attention has
been paid, viz. the protection of objects as far as possible
from even diffused daylight. Although no investigations upon
the extent of the injurious action of light have as yet been
published, light is not without influence upon the outward
appearance, and therefore also upon the material condition of
antiquities of organic origin. But even inorganic objects, such
as pigments, glass, enamel, amber, etc., are affected by light;
it is therefore certainly advisable to protect antiquities of all
kinds from light during the time in which they are not
exhibited to the public.
</p>

<p>
The public is effectually prevented from fingering antiquities
which are enclosed in glass cases, but it may be well
to remind those who have to handle them in the course of
their duties that contact with the bare hand can only be
harmful, even though fingering is understood to be beneficial
to modern bronzes by inducing the formation of patina. The
bright surface of metallic iron which results from treatment
by Blell&rsquo;s or by Krefting&rsquo;s method, especially if there is a thin
coating of paraffin, should not be touched at all with the bare
hand, but only with a cloth or a glove. Bronzes, whether
intact or restored, and iron objects, should never be in direct
contact with those which show efflorescences.
</p>

<p>
The usual custom is to attach labels of painted cardboard
or metal by means of thin metal wire. The tendency to rust
makes iron wire unsuitable, especially for objects containing
salt, which are quickly affected; thus light coloured
earthenware may soon be covered with spots of rust. Copper
wire and nickel wire are liable to be similarly attacked.
Many years ago it was noticed<a name='FA_176' id='FA_176' href='#FN_176'
class='fnanchor'>[176]</a> in the Ethnological Museum
at Berlin that nickel wire when in contact with silver objects
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164' href='#Page_164'>
[164]</a></span>
which were covered with silver chloride was destroyed by the
formation of a deliquescent green nickel salt. Silver or
platinum wire forms the most suitable means of attachment,
but if the expense of these is too great, copper or nickel wire
may be used, except in the cases mentioned above.
</p>

<p>
Small objects of any kind, which one still frequently finds
kept in open cases, are better preserved in upright glass
cylinders with glass stoppers, or in cheaper glass tubes, one
end of which is fused and the other closed with a cork.
</p>

<p>
There will be no difficulty in the choice of methods for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165' href='#Page_165'>
[165]</a></span>
limestone or earthenware, whether kiln-dried or sun-dried, for
a simple experiment will prove whether steeping is likely to
cause injury or disintegration.
</p>

<p>
The methods are themselves simple and inexpensive. For
organic substances the chief question is the choice of the most
suitable medium for impregnation.
</p>

<p>
Iron and bronze present some difficulty, although the use
of a file will readily show whether reduction is feasible.
</p>

<p>
The simplicity of the apparatus required for Krefting&rsquo;s
method gives it an advantage over other methods, at any rate
for iron objects. Objection has been taken to the methods
of reduction, because they give to the objects thus treated an
appearance to which the public are not accustomed. It may
be safely asserted however that this appearance more truly
represents the object when in actual use, than the oxidized
and rust-covered specimens to which we are accustomed in
antiquarian collections. To those who value an antique object
for the crust that covers it, all methods of restoration must be
objectionable. Such persons ought to object to the removal
of the incrustations which hide the cuneiform inscriptions on
clay tablets. On the other hand, those who regard these
methods with approval should go a step further and confide
their collections to experienced hands for some form of treatment
which may bring to light inscriptions and inlaid work
which will greatly enhance their value.
</p>

<p>
To spread the knowledge of these methods and to invite
the co-operation of others is the aim of this book. As to the
best method to be used in each particular case it is unnecessary
to lay down any hard and fast rule, for this can only
be learned by observation and experience.

<h3>
APPENDIX A.<br />
METHOD OF TAKING SQUEEZES OF INSCRIPTIONS, ETC.
</h3>


<p>
For this purpose a proper brush is required with strong
bristles, closely set as in a scrubbing brush; the brush should
have a firmly fixed handle, preferably slightly curving upwards
to save the knuckles from being bruised upon the stone. A
so-called &ldquo;silver brush&rdquo; will serve the purpose. The paper
should be stout and stiff enough to resist the blows of the
brush without tearing. An admirable paper, which possesses
these qualities, is specially prepared for the purpose by the
O.W. Company, 100, Great Russell Street, London, W. As
a substitute for the specially prepared paper stout packing
paper may be used with satisfactory results.
</p>

<p>
The stone should be tilted if possible at an angle of about
45&deg;, and the surface bearing the inscription should be well
washed or carefully scraped free of dirt and foreign matter
and should be rendered thoroughly wet. A piece of the
special paper of suitable size should be soaked in water
for a minute or more. It should then be carefully applied
to the surface of the stone in such a way as to prevent
air-bubbles. This may be assisted by gently smoothing it
with the hand or back of the brush. When close adhesion
has been secured, and all air-bubbles removed (this can sometimes
be done by pricking through the paper with a pin), the
paper should be sharply beaten with the brush, the blows
being delivered from the wrist and not from the shoulder
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167' href='#Page_167'>
[167]</a></span>
until it begins to show a fluffy appearance. It should then
be peeled off and allowed to dry, after which it may be rolled
or folded without danger of injury to the embossed inscription.
</p>

<p>
Should the paper tear, another piece soaked as before
may be placed on the top and beaten until it becomes incorporated
with the first. If the letters are large and deep,
or if the surface is much cracked, two or more sheets superimposed
should be used. In the case of large inscriptions it
is advisable to take impressions by sections, care being taken
that each sheet slightly overlaps the preceding one to prevent
the possible omission of some of the letters.
</p>

<p>
It is also useful to take at the same time a pen or pencil
copy of the inscription, for a comparison of the copy and the
squeeze will often prevent errors in deciphering. The squeezes
can be very well deciphered by artificial light, while doubtful
letters may sometimes become clear on holding up the sheet
to the light. The reverse side of the squeeze, upon which the
inscription stands in relief, may afford great assistance when
read by the aid of a mirror. A photograph of the squeeze
will often reveal more than a photograph of the inscription
itself.
</p>

The method is described by S. Reinach in his &ldquo;Trait&eacute;
d&rsquo;&Eacute;pigraphie Grecque&rdquo; (Introduction, p. <span class='smcap'>XX.
</span>), where he also
refers to H&uuml;bner, &ldquo;Ueber mechanische Copien von Inschriften,&rdquo;

<h3>
APPENDIX B.<br />
ZAPON.
</h3>


<p>
Further particulars may be given of the new preparation
known as Zapon. This substance is now made on a large
scale, and can be obtained from the British Xylonite Co.,
Brantham Works, Manningtree (Xylonite lacquer F. 6631).
The following excerpt is from a short communication in
&ldquo;Prometheus&rdquo; (<span class='smcap'>XV.</span> 1904, pp. 485 and 499),
which deals with
the preservation of wax seals and of glass.
</p>

<p>
Zapon, the invention of Crane, of Shorthills, U.S.A.,
has been used for 20 years past for the protection of metals
from oxidation and the action of sulphuretted hydrogen.
Although the products of the various manufacturing firms
differ in composition, zapon is essentially a solution of
nitro-cellulose in various solvents. The nitrated cellulose,
i.e. gun-cotton (pyroxyline), is generally, with the addition
of camphor, dissolved in a mixture of amyl acetate (hence
the peardrop-like smell) to which distillation products of
petroleum, etc., are added. It comes into the market as a
faintly yellow, slightly oily liquid. Its use as a preservative
depends upon the fact that the evaporation of the solvent
leaves behind it a fine transparent coating of gun-cotton
(pyroxyline). Zapon for preservative purposes must have
a neutral reaction, and must not under any circumstances
redden litmus paper. Its use in this connection is due
to Schill, who also recognised its suitability for other
materials, as, for example, for plaster casts, the treatment of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169' href='#Page_169'>
[169]</a></span>
which is eminently simple, for it consists in dipping small
casts, or in painting larger ones with a soft brush. It is
advisable to begin at the top and apply it from above downwards,
using a clean dry cloth to wipe off any excess of the
fluid which collects in the deeper parts of the cast. If zapon
containing about 4% of gun-cotton is used, the coating left
on drying is scarcely visible; with a 5% solution a certain
degree of polish results. Casts treated with zapon are less
easily damaged by dust than those untreated, and may be
cleaned with soap and water without injury to their surface,
provided that a soft brush is used, but brushes which are stiff
enough to injure the zapon coating will damage the contours
of the statue. It should only be used for objects kept under
cover, for rain and wide variations of temperature will attack
them almost as readily as untreated casts. It can be used
with equal success for antiquities of stone, clay, baked or
unbaked, or for plaster after the soluble salts have been
thoroughly removed by steeping, for if this has not been done
the salts will soon crystallize out and loosen the protective
coating. For objects which are free from salts impregnation
with zapon possesses the advantage that it renders them less
liable to damage from handling or dust, whilst the appearance
is scarcely altered, if at all. This applies also to
antiquities of metal, for unless the injurious chlorine compounds
are removed by simple steeping, or reduction and
subsequent steeping, treatment with zapon is useless. To
bronzes, which in spite of mechanical cleaning show a somewhat
unpleasant grey non-metallic appearance, zapon often
imparts a distinct metallic lustre. To enhance this lustre by
a second vigorous application is not recommended, for this
gives the impression of a varnish. To protect articles of
silver from the blackening influence of sulphuretted hydrogen,
zapon is very useful, but does not afford absolute protection
unless it has been thickly applied. In collections of armour
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170' href='#Page_170'>
[170]</a></span>
much use may be found for this material. The objects are
dipped and then placed in a drying oven at 105&deg;F. [40&deg;C.]
to secure rapid drying and uniform distribution. The amyl
acetate or other solvent is best conducted away, as it
evaporates, into a flue or into the open, although the vapours
can hardly be considered dangerous to health.

<div class='footnote' id='FN_16'>
<p><span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_16'>[16]</a></span> [It may not be out
of place here to give the main conclusions, drawn
from a long series of experiments by Prof. W. R. Dunstan (&ldquo;Proc. Chem.
Soc.,&rdquo; <span class='smcap'>XIX.</span> 150, 1903).</p>

<p>
(<i>a</i>) Pure iron is not oxidised in the presence of gases and
water-vapour
only, but for the appearance of rust the presence of water in the
liquid state is necessary.
</p>

<p>
(<i>b</i>) The reagents which prevent the rusting of iron are those in the
presence of which hydrogen peroxide is decomposed, and which are
consequently inimical to its formation: among such reagents the following
are given&mdash;sodium chloride, sodium sulphate, ferrous sulphate and
potassium nitrate.
</p>

<p>
(<i>c</i>) The action of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on metallic iron leads
 to the production
of red basic ferric hydroxide, which is identical with ordinary rust.
The composition of rust may therefore be represented by the formula
Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>, the reaction being
represented by the equations:
</p>


<p class="chem-eq">
Fe + O<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = FeO +
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.<br />
2FeO + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> =
Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>.
</p>

<p>
These views are however combated by Moody (&ldquo;Proc. Chem. Soc.,&rdquo;
<span class='smcap'>XIX.</span> 157 and 239) who concludes that aerial
rusting must be regarded as
a change involving the interaction of iron and carbonic acid and the
subsequent formation of rust by oxidation of the ferrous salt.
</p>

<p>
He also states that those salts which do not combine with and which
are not decomposed by CO<sub>2</sub> have no retarding influence on the
formation
of rust, e.g. sodium chloride, sodium sulphate, etc.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand substances which absorb and combine with carbonic
oxide (e.g. sodium carbonate or hydroxide, ammonium carbonate,
calcium hydroxide), or which are decomposed by carbonic acid (potassium
and sodium nitrites), inhibit rusting, which may therefore be
regarded as a change involving the interaction of iron and acid and the
subsequent formation of rust by the oxidation of the ferrous salt.
</p>

<p>
O. Kr&ouml;hnke (&ldquo;Wochensch. Brauerei,&rdquo; <span class='smcap'>XVII.</span>
233) gives the following
equations:
</p>


<p class="chem-eq">
Fe + 2CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = Fe(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> +
H<sub>2</sub>.<br />
2Fe(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + O + H<sub>2</sub>O =
2Fe(OH)<sub>2</sub> + 4CO<sub>2</sub>.
</p>

<p>
Comp. also Dammer, &ldquo;Handbuch der anorg. Chem.,&rdquo; Vols.
<span class='smcap'>III.</span> and <span class='smcap'>IV.</span>
(supplement).
</p>

<p>
Considerable attention has also been directed to the influence of
bacteria upon iron. Thus the growth of Crenothrix may cause much
trouble in waterworks, vide &ldquo;Centralblatt f&uuml;r Bakterien und
Parasitenkunde,&rdquo;
<span class='smcap'>II.</span> 12, 681. A variety, Chlamydothrix
(Gallionella) ferruginea
(Mig.) appears to play an important part in the formation of rust (comp.
Zopf, &ldquo;Crenothrix polyspora die Ursache der Berliner
Wasser-Calamit&auml;t,&rdquo;
Berlin, 1879. De Vries, &ldquo;Unter. der Crenothrix Commission,&rdquo; Rotterdam,
1887 and 1890).
</p>

<p>
Neufeld (&ldquo;Chem. Centralblatt,&rdquo; 1904, <span class='smcap'>I.</span>
1621&mdash;abstracted from &ldquo;Zeitschrift
f&uuml;r Untersuchung der N&auml;hrungs- und Genussmittel,&rdquo; <span
class='smcap'>VII.</span> 478)
gives particulars of three varieties: Crenothrix polyspora, which separates
iron; Cr. ochracea, which separates aluminium and some iron; and
Cr. manganifera, which separates manganese.
</p>

<p>
Jackson (&ldquo;Journal of Society of Chemical Industry,&rdquo; 1902, p. 681)
gives micro-photographs of these varieties. Microscopically the masses
of Crenothrix are seen enclosed in a gelatinous sheath, in which is
imbedded the precipitated metallic hydrate. It is ana&euml;robic and its
action is favoured by absence of light. In the absence of dissolved
oxygen, the bacillus appears to take its iron from the pipes. Cr.
polyspora
is found however (&ldquo;Zeitschrift f&uuml;r analytische Chemie,&rdquo;
<span class='smcap'>XLII.</span> 590)
to separate the iron not from the ferrous carbonate (FeCO<sub>3</sub>) but from
iron organically combined. See also Winogradsky, Ueber Eisenbakterien,

In the second column the chlorine has been calculated as copper chloride,
the remaining copper and other metals as oxides.
</p>

<p>
Traces of calcium were also found, but the amount of sodium was so
small that it could only be detected by the flame test. If all the copper
had been present as basic chloride (atacamite CuCl<sub>2</sub>, 3CuO,
3H<sub>2</sub>O), this
would require 26&middot;84% CuCl<sub>2</sub>, 47&middot;57% CuO, and
10&middot;78% H<sub>2</sub>O. It would
therefore appear that the substance produced by corrosion is less basic
than atacamite, and that ammonium chloride may have played a more
important part than sodium chloride in the formation of copper chloride,
for in this case the sodium was only found in amount too small for
estimation.
</p>

<p>
An analysis of the earliest piece of bronze known, i.e. that from
M&ecirc;d&ucirc;m, Egypt (3700 <span class='smcap'>B.C.</span>), gives
8&middot;4% of tin (inner core 9&middot;1%) to 89&middot;8
of copper with a small quantity of arsenic.
</p>

<p>
An analysis of a celt from the Dowris find (King&rsquo;s County, Ireland,
1825) gave copper, 85&middot;23; tin 13&middot;11; lead 1&middot;14,
with traces of sulphur and
carbon. The waste material from the same place yielded 89% copper,
11% tin, with traces only of lead, iron and silver.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand an early bronze celt (Butterwick, E.R., Yorks.)
showed a smaller quantity of tin&mdash;10&middot;74%, compared with
87&middot;97% of
copper. (Guide to Bronze Age Antiquities, British Museum.)

Columns <span class='smcap'>I</span> and <span class='smcap'>II</span>
the amount of metallic copper of the patina is indeed
smaller, but so is also that of lead and especially of tin. But this may
be due to a faulty method in the determination of tin noticed by Olshausen
(v. &ldquo;Verhandl. d. Berl. anthropol. Ges.,&rdquo; 1897, p. 349). The different
proportion of the copper compounds in the patina should also be noted,
Schuler giving carbonate and hydrate in the proportion 1:1, Arche and
Hassack once as 1:2, and again as the result of two analyses as 1:3.

<p><span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_85'>[85]</a></span> It has been found
that the formation of this layer of slime may be
avoided by the use of tubs which are lined with sheet zinc. The addition
of 10-20 cubic centimetres of formalin [40% solution of formaldehyde]
to every hundred gallons of water also prevents or restrains the formation
of slime. It is not necessary to add formalin each time the water is
changed.

<div class='footnote' id='FN_86'>
<p><span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_86'>[86]</a></span> Since chlorine
compounds (especially common salt) form the predominating
substance in the soluble salts contained in limestones their
removal may be considered a proof that other salts (e.g. sulphates) have
also been removed. Hence it is sufficient to prove the disappearance of
chlorine. In the rare cases in which sulphates only are present, a test
similar to that mentioned on <a href="#Page_77">p. 77</a>, applied to clay objects, should be
used. If the water used for soaking salt-containing limestone, earthenware,
etc., gives no precipitate, or only turbidity with the silver solution,
the determination of chlorine by titration is not applicable.

kinds of burette may be easier to use, that here
recommended (that of Gay-Lussac) is the most convenient for reasons
into which we need not enter. The following precautions should be
observed: where the burette is not closed by a cork, let a few drops
out first to wash away crystals of silver nitrate which may have formed
at the mouth. The silver solution should be kept in well stoppered
bottles. When filling the burette a glass funnel should be used, so
that the cork used for closing the burette is not wetted with the silver
solution. Before reading off wait until the level of the fluid is constant,
in order that any solution on the sides of the glass tube may have time
to run down.

Stralau Waterworks often required 0&middot;8 c.c. silver solution: but at
that
time stronger disinfectants were used on account of the cholera, and
this may have caused the increase of chlorine; for since then, and
even at the present time (winter 1898), 100 c.c. tap-water requires
0&middot;5

<span class='smcap'>XXVII</span>. 1903, p. 454) imbeds iron objects which
have a very weak core in a
zinc-wire basket immersed in a magma of zinc dust and caustic soda.
Personally I should prefer not to attempt a reduction process in such
cases, but should rely rather upon mechanical removal of the rust, soaking
and impregnation. For the treatment of bronzes this observer
prefers the Finkener method (q. v.) and suggests caustic soda, sodium
chloride, or ammonia chloride, instead of potassium cyanide as the
electrolyte.
Rhousopulos (&ldquo;Chemische Zeitschrift,&rdquo; <span class='smcap'>II.</span> 1903,
pp. 202 and
364) uses zinc and hydrochloric acid, and when dry gives to the bronze
a coating of wax. I should deprecate the use of either of these substances,
the hydrochloric acid because of the difficulty of completely removing it
by steeping and the danger of subsequent decomposition of the bronze,
the wax because the contained fatty acids may act upon the metal.

<p><span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_128'>[128]</a></span> Krefting&rsquo;s method
affords an excellent illustration of the truth of
my remarks in the preface that the literature upon these
preservation-methods
is very scattered and in consequence has been hitherto but
little studied. In 1892, when visiting the Museum at Christiania, I had
the opportunity of examining some iron objects which had been treated
by Krefting&rsquo;s method. I then obtained his address, and Herr Krefting
kindly communicated his method to me by letter, and in the following
year forwarded a reprint of his article referred to above. In 1887 he
had described his method to Appelgren by letter, but at that time he
treated the object after reduction, washing, and drying, by impregnating
it with a paraffin-petroleum solution. In 1897 Appelgren published
this method, with drying and impregnation, in ignorance of Krefting&rsquo;s
publication in 1893.

<p><span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_129'>[129]</a></span> The bottle should
not be closed by a glass stopper, but by a rubber
bung, or by a cork coated with paraffin or wrapped round with parchment.
Soda solution attacks glass, and especially ground glass; thus the stopper
may become so firmly fixed into the neck of the bottle as to render its
removal impossible.

advisable. The bronze is again wiped and introduced into a drying

Either of these media should be applied very thinly and then polished

fill up the damaged surface of the leather. In some cases the addition
of some dye such as logwood, or one or other of the acid coal-tar dyes, is

on the animal enemies of paper, leather, and wood, and their destruction
by means of carbon bisulphide. Carbon bisulphide is an infallible poison
and has no effect upon colours when used in a perfectly dry state.
This may be carried out by a preliminary displacement of the air by
carbonic acid which is readily obtained in the liquid form in cylinders.
Benzine would probably act equally well, but would require a longer
time for its action. References to other methods such as the employment
of a vacuum or of heat will be found in the same publication.
